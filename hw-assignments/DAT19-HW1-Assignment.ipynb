Socio-economic class does seem to have an impact, too, with people in higher class having higher survival rate. The age difference between the survivors and non-survivors is not very big, so if pressed for time, I'd probably leave it out.\n",

    "I think it is important to keep in mind that these are simple observations between two variables (survival rate and an potential predictor). The predictors can be correlated with each other too, for example, age with class. So I'd do a correlation matrix with all variables to decide. But even in that case, it is a linear correlation, if there are more complex relationships, it will not discover that."
