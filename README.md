* Browsing or searching the Pandas [API Reference](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html) is an excellent way to locate a function even if you don't know its exact name.
* If you want to go really deep into Pandas (and NumPy), read the book [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do) by Wes McKinney, the creator of Pandas. Ping me on Slack for a discount code.
* Here are examples of different types of [joins in Pandas](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/working-with-pandas-dataframes/#joining), for when you need to figure out how to merge two DataFrames.
* **Optional:** Read the [Teaching Assistant Evaluation dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Teaching+Assistant+Evaluation) into Pandas, create the X and y objects (the response variable is "class attribute"), and go through scikit-learn's 4-step modeling process. (There's no need to submit your code unless you have a question or would like feedback!)

**Model Evaluation Resources**
* For more on cross-validation, read section 5.1 of [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) (11 pages)
* For another explanation of training error versus testing error, the bias-variance tradeoff, and train/test split (also known as the "validation set approach"), watch Hastie and Tibshirani's video on [estimating prediction error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2ij6eaaSl0&t=2m34s) (12 minutes, starting at 2:34).
* Caltech's Learning From Data course includes a fantastic video on [visualizing bias and variance](http://work.caltech.edu/library/081.html) (15 minutes).
* [Random Test/Train Split is Not Always Enough](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2015/01/random-testtrain-split-is-not-always-enough/) explains why random train/test split may not be a suitable model evaluation procedure if your data has a significant time element.

**Additional Resources:**
* [What I do when I get a new data set as told through tweets](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/13/what-i-do-when-i-get-a-new-data-set-as-told-through-tweets/) is a fun (yet enlightening) look at the process of exploratory data analysis.

* To go much more in-depth on linear regression, read Chapter 3 of [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/), from which this lesson was adapted. Alternatively, watch the [related videos](http://www.dataschool.io/15-hours-of-expert-machine-learning-videos/) or read my [quick reference guide](http://www.dataschool.io/applying-and-interpreting-linear-regression/) to the key points in that chapter.
* To learn more about Statsmodels and how to interpret the output, DataRobot has some decent posts on [simple linear regression](http://www.datarobot.com/blog/ordinary-least-squares-in-python/) and [multiple linear regression](http://www.datarobot.com/blog/multiple-regression-using-statsmodels/).
* This [introduction to linear regression](http://people.duke.edu/~rnau/regintro.htm) is much more detailed and mathematically thorough, and includes lots of good advice.
* This is a relatively quick post on the [assumptions of linear regression](http://pareonline.net/getvn.asp?n=2&v=8).
* John Rauser's talk on [Statistics Without the Agonizing Pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dnw46eC-0o) (12 minutes) gives a great explanation of how the null hypothesis is rejected.

-----

### Class 7: Logistic Regression

* When applying Naive Bayes classification to a dataset with continuous features, it is best to use [GaussianNB](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB.html) rather than [MultinomialNB](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html). Wikipedia has a short [description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier#Gaussian_naive_Bayes) of Gaussian Naive Bayes, as well as an excellent [example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier#Sex_classification) of its usage.
* These [slides](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/teaching/DATA_DIGGING/lecture_05.pdf) from the University of Maryland provide more mathematical details on both logistic regression and Naive Bayes, and also explain how Naive Bayes is actually a "special case" of logistic regression.
* Andrew Ng has a [paper](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/ang//papers/nips01-discriminativegenerative.pdf) comparing the performance of logistic regression and Naive Bayes across a variety of datasets.
* If you enjoyed Paul Graham's article, you can read [his follow-up article](http://www.paulgraham.com/better.html) on how he improved his spam filter and this [related paper](http://www.merl.com/publications/docs/TR2004-091.pdf) about state-of-the-art spam filtering in 2004.

**Web Scraping Resources:**
* The [Beautiful Soup documentation](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) is incredibly thorough, but is hard to use as a reference guide. However, the section on [specifying a parser](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#specifying-the-parser-to-use) may be helpful if Beautiful Soup appears to be parsing a page incorrectly.
* For more Beautiful Soup examples and tutorials, see [Web Scraping 101 with Python](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/03/03/web-scraping-101-with-python/), Alex's well-commented notebook on [scraping Craigslist](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Alexjmsherman/DataScience_GeneralAssembly/blob/master/Final_Project/1.%20Final_Project_Data%20Scraping.ipynb), this [notebook](http://web.stanford.edu/~zlotnick/TextAsData/Web_Scraping_with_Beautiful_Soup.html) from Stanford's Text As Data course, and this [notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/cs109/2014/blob/master/lectures/2014_09_23-lecture/data_scraping_transcript.ipynb) and associated [video](http://cm.dce.harvard.edu/2015/01/14328/L07/screen_H264LargeTalkingHead-16x9.shtml) from Harvard's Data Science course.
* For a much longer web scraping tutorial covering Beautiful Soup, lxml, XPath, and Selenium, watch [Web Scraping with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1iX0uxM1w8) (3 hours 23 minutes) from PyCon 2014. The [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uHM_esB13VuSf7O1ScGueisnrtu-6usGFD3fs4z5YCE/edit#slide=id.p) and [code](https://github.com/kjam/python-web-scraping-tutorial) are also available.
* For more complex web scraping projects, [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) is a popular application framework that works with Python. It has excellent [documentation](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/1.0/index.html), and here's a [tutorial](https://github.com/rdempsey/ddl-data-wrangling) with detailed slides and code.
* [robotstxt.org](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html) has a concise explanation of how to write (and read) the `robots.txt` file.
* [import.io](https://import.io/) and [Kimono](https://www.kimonolabs.com/) claim to allow you to scrape websites without writing any code.
* [How a Math Genius Hacked OkCupid to Find True Love](http://www.wired.com/2014/01/how-to-hack-okcupid/all/) and [How Netflix Reverse Engineered Hollywood](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/?single_page=true) are two fun examples of how web scraping has been used to build interesting datasets.
