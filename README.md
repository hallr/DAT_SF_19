### Class 1: Introduction to Data Science
* Welcome from General Assembly staff
* Course overview ([slides](slides/01_course_intro.pdf))
* Introduction to data science ([slides](slides/01_intro_to_data_science.pdf))
* Command line & exercise ([code](code/02_command_line.md))
* Exit tickets


**Homework:**
* Work through GA's friendly [command line tutorial](http://generalassembly.github.io/prework/command-line/#/) using Terminal (Linux/Mac) or Git Bash (Windows), and then browse through this [command line reference](code/02_command_line.md).
* Watch videos 1 through 8 (21 minutes) of [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5IBLMp7LtN8Nc3Efd4hJq0kD).
* If your laptop has any setup issues, please work with us to resolve them by Wednesday.

**Resources:**
* For a useful look at the different types of data scientists, read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) (32 pages).
* For some thoughts on what it's like to be a data scientist, read these short posts from [Win-Vector](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2012/09/on-being-a-data-scientist/) and [Datascope Analytics](http://datascopeanalytics.com/what-we-think/2014/07/31/six-qualities-of-a-great-data-scientist).
* Quora has a [data science topic FAQ](https://www.quora.com/Data-Science) with lots of interesting Q&A.

-----

### Class 2: Version Control
* Final project presentations from other class
* Q&A on [course project](project/README.md) expectations & schedule
  * [public data sources](project/public_data.md)
* Version Control with Git and GitHub ([slides](slides/02_version_control_git.pdf))
* [Git Configuration and Github setup](other/git_github_setup.md)
* Moved to Class 3: Intro to Python ([slides](slides/02_intro_to_python.pdf))
* Exit tickets


**Homework:**
* If you haven't already, complete the homework exercise listed in the [command line introduction](code/02_command_line.md#homework-exercise). Create a Markdown document that includes your answers and the code you used to arrive at those answers. Add this file to a GitHub repo that you'll use for all of your coursework, and submit a link to your repo using the homework submission form.

<!--
* Review the code from the [beginner](code/00_python_beginner_workshop.py) and [intermediate](code/00_python_intermediate_workshop.py) Python workshops. If you don't feel comfortable with any of the content (up through the "dictionaries" section), you should spend some time this weekend practicing Python. Here are my recommended resources:
    * If you like learning from a book, [Python for Informatics](http://www.pythonlearn.com/html-270/) has useful chapters on strings, lists, and dictionaries.
    * If you prefer interactive exercises, try these lessons from [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python): "Python Lists and Dictionaries" and "A Day at the Supermarket".
    * If you have more time, try these much longer lessons from [DataQuest](https://dataquest.io/missions): "Find the US city with the lowest crime rate" and "Discover weather patterns in LA".
    * If you've already mastered these topics and want more of a challenge, try solving the second [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) and send me your code in Slack.
* If there are specific Python topics you want me to cover next week, send me a Slack message.
-->

**Git and Markdown Resources:**
* [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/doc) is an excellent book for learning Git. Read [Chapter 1 - Getting Started](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) and [Chapter 2 - Git Basics](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) to gain a deeper understanding of version control and basic commands.
* Very quick [Git tutorial](https://try.github.io) by Github and Codeschool. Recommended practice!
* Github's [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is a good starting point for learning github-flavored markdown.
* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) provides a thorough set of Markdown examples with concise explanations.

<!--
* If you want to practice a lot of Git (and learn many more commands), [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) looks promising.
* If you want to understand how to contribute on GitHub, you first have to understand [forks and pull requests](http://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-forks-in-github-and-git/).
* [GitRef](http://gitref.org/) is a great reference guide for Git commands, and [Git quick reference for beginners](http://www.dataschool.io/git-quick-reference-for-beginners/) is a shorter guide with commands grouped by workflow.
-->

**Command Line Resources:**
* If you want to go much deeper into the command line, [Data Science at the Command Line](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032823.do) is a great book. The [companion website](http://datascienceatthecommandline.com/) provides installation instructions for a "data science toolbox" (a virtual machine with many more command line tools), as well as a long reference guide to popular command line tools.
