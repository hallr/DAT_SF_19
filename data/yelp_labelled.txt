Wow... Loved this place.	1
I learned that if an electric slicer is used the blade becomes hot enough to start to cook the prosciutto.	
But they don't clean the chiles?	
Crust is not good.	0
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	0
Pancake was WAY bigger than I thought and kind of regretted getting now since I couldn't finish it.	
Thai Orchid's menu offers a vast choice of authentic Thai dishes.	
I guess if you're eating here, you don't really give a shit about money though.	
Sure, it's good, but it's garlic bread.	
My tortillas were falling apart from the grease and from the large quantity of the meat, cheese, and cabbage.	
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.	1
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.	1
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.	0
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)	0
Price was very reasonable.	
Watery espresso with no crema--none.	
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.	0
They seem to be saut√©ed and are in large chunks not wussy little minced things.	
The fries were great too.	1
A great touch.	1
That wasn't even all that great to begin with?	
One of the amazing berry crumb pies?	
We ordered 2 $.99 Margaritas - they couldnt get the machine to work because it was frozen so refunded our money.	
Service was very prompt.	1
Would not go back.	0
I never know who is my actual server or who to order anything from.	
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	0
Oh Sura... A Carnivore's Playground!	
I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!	1
I suggest upgrading the broth.	
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.	0
This is your typical wanna be Phoenix version of the Irish Bar.	
I can't compare it to the Persian food that I've eaten in Tehran but it was pretty good.	
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.	0
Highly recommended.	1
Good thing I tip in cash and didn't pre-tip... So, no refund, cannot find the number for Madison's delivery service, etc.	
Stopped in last night for dinner....around 7ish...so a little busy, not crazy, but steady.	
Additionally, there's no Salsa on it.....and there is no Salsa Bar.	
3 Blind Moose house wine for 3 bucks.	
Its right near Chandler High School so it gets really crowded around lunch time M-F.	
In retrospect, I wondered why they sat us there.	
About the 3rd time this happened I finally put my foot down and looked up Papa John's website.	
I'd do better with the peanuts on the flight.	
Do either one of them offer to bring me fresh fluffy eggs?	
If anything the meat was slightly on the dry side.	
I was puissed because we diddnt have it on us.	
:-) If you're coming from the south just turn left on Oakey and then right into the Pizza Hut parking lot, it's behind Pizza Hut.	
When I asked about some of the dishes, they directed me away from those that they didn't think we'd appreciate.	
The mushrooms had very good flavor but I would have like more caps than stems.	
I've been here twice already and both times I ordered the bento box.	
Waitress was a little slow in service.	0
This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.	0
did not like at all.	0
The Burrittos Blah!	0
Pointed to it on the menu.	
My friend and I stood between several tables with people at them looking at us looking at them.	
Expect a full house, with plenty of noise.	
The food, amazing.	1
Service is also cute.	1
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.	1
After complaining and doing an incident report we were moved to a room on the 17th floor.	
So they performed.	1
That's okay though, because I'm old enough that I can tolerate things I don't like a lot better than when I was younger.	
You get quite friendly with your neighbors, which is good if you are social, or if you just want to look at their food.	
They even have coca-cola in the bottle!	
This is NOT an upscale place - they're in a strip mall - and they should be pleased to greet any guest walking through the door.	
See ya next time, ehhhh ciao	
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.	1
: ) Despite service issues, I would definitely return and highly recommend!	
His attitude is that he doesn't eat decor or tablecloths, he eats food... and you know, he is right.	
- They never brought a salad we asked for.	0
This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.	1
Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.	0
The worst was the salmon sashimi.	0
I asked for a steak knife - which it should have been served with.	
I live in Henderson, and commute to work as I must, I now wake up on my days off and gladly make the drive to try something new.	
I only ate 1 bite, and the shrimp itself was tasty.	
Cheese is good friend of mine.	
Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.	1
This was like the final blow!	0
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.	1
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.	0
Put out Ranch Dressing or BBQ Sauce in your condiment line-up and I'm even happier.	
Overall, I like this place a lot.	1
She was drawn to the tri-tip because the menu said lemon and garlic neither of which was evident in any way.	
or something..../) He continued to monitor our table the rest of the evening with a distinct 'Have the complainers left yet?'	
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.	1
Went to Cafe Moda to meet up a whole bunch of guy friends at about 2am on a Friday night.	
Ample portions and good prices.	1
Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.	0
she may have even rolled her eyes behind her glasses.	
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!	1
Service sucks.	0
Please read my first review for details.	
The shrimp tender and moist.	1
Like so many other things in Phoenix/Scottsdale, this place looks great on the outside but lacks substance.	
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.	0
I'd pay money to see one of the Scottsdale nightclub service brats try and keep up with her for a night!	
If you look directly in the hall way you should see a TV and a pin ball machine.	
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.	0
On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.	1
These are a must try.	
This is pretty much standard SYSCO food supply.	
Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.	0
Spring rolls are delicious but small.	
Maybe I'm just fortunate, or maybe it's just that good!	
On the downside the sushi that came off of this menu was unappetizing and the chicken katsu was the best thing I had that day.	
My lady asked for a green tea smoothie since they forgot our beverages.	
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.	1
2 - My dad goes here a LOT, like, the owner knows him by name.	
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.	0
I came back after a couple of years to get my usual corned beef hash w/ scrambled eggs and hot chocolate.	
The burger is good beef, cooked just right.	1
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!	1
He came back and said that the Manager said there wasn't anything she could do since it was a special order anyway.	
OR are you a really good place?	
Sat down and saw people getting seated that came in after I did.	
My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.	1
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.	1
After spending over 8 years as a server and front of house manager in restaurants I know what to expect and how to treat customers.	
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.	1
Alright fine.	
There sauces compliment the food, where most places use sauce to cover up the food.	
So, how did everything turn out?	
Thanks Cooper!	
My brain has exploded with new possibilities.	
Their chow mein is so good!	1
They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.	0
The bartender said "They are $4 actually..." The guy left pissed.	
It kinda turned my stomach to where I couldn't really eat the other items.	
The portion was huge!	1
I'd looked the bar up and their website made it look quite nice inside.	
This is a typical waiting for food activity, is it not?	
Then came the piece de resistance that I was waiting for the most: a 12-oz.	
I will be ordering this again, but with a red meat as I think that holds rendang flavors well.	
Wasn't really happy with that, but I'm sure they have their reasons.	
This is near my work and I drove by it all the time thinking "I should go in there."	
great food--not the same old, same old stuff.	
The bass comes with head and bones - accidentally swallowed a small bone, and I'm used to eating fish that way.	
Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.	1
If the local schools are out of session, then plan on eating a little later if you don't have time for more than an hour lunch.	
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	0
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	0
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.	1
I really want to like this Native New Yorker as it is close to my house.	
During my last trip to Las Vegas I stayed at Caesars Place and was excited to have a 24 hour restaurant downstairs.	
She eventually had to abandon her drink when it became too sweet to finish-- all the honey she couldn't taste apparently had settled on the bottom.	
The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.	0
The first being the stuffed apple delight.	
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.	0
And of course the "Market Cheese Board" had a "MKT" price of TWELVE DOLLARS.	
They make sure to make them as close to the original in Brooklyn as possible.	
Once you get your bite into ANY of their food, you'll realize that the wait was worth it.	
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!	1
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.	1
It may have been the workers that were here this particular day.	
We'd definitely go back here again.	1
You practically had to take the stairs to get to the soup.	
Dumbfounded.	
Cold brew coffee, whole bean sales and home brewing equipment.	
PS: The gals get a rose upon entry which you can give to one of the many hobos or unsupervised little kids outside on the FSE.	
We are so glad we found this place.	1
Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.	1
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!	1
Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing	1
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	0
I think I spend more time waiting at oreganos than I do dining.	
A great way to finish a great.	1
Last visit had a mix up on my order.	
Anyway, unlike my experience at Holsteins (which I do like better even though I give them both the same star rating) I did have a boozy milkshake.	
The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.	1
My only complaint is could have used more meat to noodle ratio.	
hot room, but at least i had a nice view of the pool.	
3 pieces, equivalent serving to maybe 1 maki roll.	
As a side note, The coffee machine was broken and they take cash only.	
- Really, really good rice, all the time.	1
To top it all off, I ordered Chicken parm and you would normally get 2 nice size pieces with a crunchy breading.	
The service was meh.	0
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.	0
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	0
It can easily be pushed aside.	
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.	0
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !	0
It was outstanding and well balanced, with a side of sauteed mushrooms on the plate that she subbed for the mashed potatoes.	
My friend said "Maybe they come and switch out the lamps after you sit down just like on the commercial?"	
The service was bad but I am glad they had New Castle on tap.	
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.	1
I'm not a huge fan of greasy fried food so can't speak for their fish and chips.	
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.	1
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.	0
Brand New location on the perimeter of the Paradise Valley Mall, I saw the notice on Facebook today and had to order a pizza today.	
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	0
The cream sauce was so bland that I had to dress it up with condiments on the table.	
The turkey and roast beef were bland.	0
First of all, seeing an almost empty place on Saturday night did not reassure me at all!!	
This place has it!	1
The wings are okay.	
My husband doesn't like cilantro so our waitress out the pico de gallo on the side for me.	
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	0
I am excited to see this place make it big, very different concept.	
Line was long as usual.	
(It was 8pm on a Saturday.)	
If I didn't drop a minimum of $20 on every visit they'd definitely get 5 stars.	
The food was good, we probably would have returned if it was not for the horrible customer service.	
It was completely empty inside but what do you expect for late Sunday lunch time?	
On the left side of the restaurant were about 4 bar tables with stools.	
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.	1
Only reason why I've been here are those drunken late nights and nothing is open.	
The fries were quite tasty though :) For $9 a sandwich, give me fresh bread!	
Still the restaurant of choice when my and the girlfriend comes.	
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	0
That cracked me up.	
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!	1
Omelets are to die for!	1
I think management really needs to work on their employees customer service skills.	
I could swear my plate was mooing back at me.	
We also tried the figs stuffed with chorizo.	
We were presented with the check at 7:25 p.m.	
The entire restaraunt is open air, so there was a nice breeze keeping things light in there.	
It's not on the menu but they have no problem making them.	
kind of like and old persons house.	
My summers comprise of late nights driving to various places in the city.	
I suppose it's my fault for thinking I should try something different from Glass Nickel for a change.	
Everything was fresh and delicious!	1
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.	0
They give you as little as possible.	
I am such a sucker for Italian!!	
Excited for Jane's Addiction and Fishbone next weekend!	
The sauce was not in a quantity to make the dish messy and hide the texture of the cr√™pe.	
Like sludge!!!	
Like every other place, the longer you wait to get in here, the longer your going to spend waiting for breakfast.	
It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.	1
Patrick holding a pint!	
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!	0
Best breakfast buffet!!!	1
say bye bye to your tip lady!	0
I like the feel of that.	
We'll never go again.	0
Will be back again!	1
They should require some kind of dress code or at least collared shirts and slacks.	
Food arrived quickly!	1
There were more items, but I guess they weren't good enough for me to remember the dishes.	
It was not good.	0
On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.	1
We got a table in the kitchen and were treated well.	
We all agree we would have preferred that.	
Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!	1
The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.	1
Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.	1
We were finally on our way to bad food ground zero!	
Tempe seems to be the edge of our "travel for food and drink zone".	
When they come back, you will continue to have a job.	
We shared a Salami Panino (Panini is plural before you criticize....) & also a bowl of the lentil soup.	
I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.	1
Definitely not romantic or intimate.	
Oh well you don't know until you try right?	
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.	1
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!	1
The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!	1
We got our order quickly and had ordered the medium fat burger.	
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.	1
Will go back next trip out.	1
Sooooo good!!	1
BBQ bacon cheese burger and chicken wings are excellent.	
i was dying of dehydration!	
That was a vanilla shake right?	
The rolls weren't great but weren't bad.	
Well, here were are two hours later.	
REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.	0
It is served as a big chunk rather than thinly sliced.	
At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.	0
And finally after he ducks in the back again he came back with the check.	
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.	1
He sat there while you took out your crappy life on him.	
Too bad the security is lame because they don't let anyone 6" and over ride it.	
Nice, spicy and tender.	1
PAD THAI: Tiny little noodles and it makes your neighborhood Thai place embarrassed to use ketchup!	
No thanks on trying the food here if that's the case.	
What I did not realize was that this only covers water.	
Good prices.	1
I'm sorry but if you claim to be such a great coffee shop you should know what the heck you're doing and so should your employees.	
If not for the decor, do it for the food.	
Check it out.	1
He explained that they've been very busy and therefore had run out of lots of things.	
You can play shuffle board, ping pong, corn hole, and/or chat.	
I was in town visiting a friend and he said this was a good local bar where we could have a couple beer and play a game of poker.	
Lastly, be prepared to wait after dinner to take the elevator back down if it's past 11pm as patrons are being shuttled up to the club.	
It was pretty gross!	0
hot peppers and basil.	
HMMM.....just like that relationship, Nine Fine Irishmen left me...totally dissatisfied.	
Our salad was good, and the clam chowder was average.	
I've had better atmosphere.	0
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0
On the plus side, the wait was much much shorter.	
No comparison.	
I'm sure I would have given them a better score had it not been for the slowness of the waiter checking on us.	
We kept watching food for the table behind us whiz past while we could only stare longingly at it.	
I do understand that is just what they do but weird.	
The country toast was mouth watering.	
We had to ask a waiter to pass on the message to our waitress.	
The baked ziti, was just that, with lots of gooey mozzarella cheese and ricotta.	
Service is slow, food isn't "normal" OG quality.	
For desert, my husband and I had 1 slice of their Very Red Velvet Cake.	
The decor is just kitchy enough to add to the authenticity without being corny.	
Way too sweet... But that seems to be the recurring theme: every single thing on the menu it seems has a sweet flavor.	
Apparently it is rocket science to address this.	
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.	0
You have to flag someone down if you want a to go box, extras, a napkin, anything.	
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	0
Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.	0
bottom line.	
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.	1
They serve the chicken pulled apart , which I wasn't crazy about.	
The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.	1
We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.	1
We had the Omikase -- $100 per person -- so it's a bit steep but we thought the quality was way worth it.	
Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!	0
Thought I'd give them a chance to redeem themselves with a canoli for dessert.	
Which still blows my mind how that can do that because it's all laid down step by step how to make some thing.	
We had a great server however the food was not good and we wont be back.	
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	0
Garlic fail number 2.	
The pizza looked good, the appetizer did not.	
So breakdown: 3 stars = Service from the girls 1 star = Food -2 stars = the cooks not getting the order right, and being pushy for us to leave.	
Fish tacos cames with a tiny cup of salsa.	
The salt and pepper fried shrimp was small and over-fried.	
dirty floors and counters and the pop machine was leaking all over the place.	
Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.	1
I wouldn't return.	0
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.	1
We also bought the homemade english muffins that are huge!	
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.	0
Hence my amazement at the tiramisu.	
Penne vodka excellent!	1
They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.	1
The management is rude.	0
I had dinner with some co-workers here last week.	
Now do something about it."	
Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.	1
V and I ordered cappuccino (Cartel was out of V's favorite chai), while my cuzzo ordered an 8 oz.	
Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.	1
We were on dessert by the time water arrived.	
I have never had anything like it.	
Definitely not a deal that I could pass up.	
I had the Caesar salad that came with my fiance's salmon entree and the appetizer of rolled steak filled with asparagus and cheese.	
I had a seriously solid breakfast here.	1
HOW THIS LOCATION SAVED MY WAISTLINE!	
WHATS WITH THE CONSTANT ........... Raising the menu prices ?????	
It wasn't fun, but it sure was funny.	
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.	1
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	0
One think I really liked about this place was the fact we had such good service, and a nice place to sit down and talk at.	
There's not much else to say.	
Service once seated took a little while as well.	
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.	1
Most of it was delicious... they really like pork and salt and sauce.	
I tasted the Black Cod and although it was very flavorful, I thought the Yuzu Miso overpowered the flavor of the cod.	
Don't do it!!!!	0
I had the Cuban pork and it was delicious along with the lemonade and my friend has the Italian sausage which he stated that was good.	
Most of the rest seems overly heavy.	
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	0
There were loads of diced tomatoes and onion in there as well.	
Our food was served within five minutes.	
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.	0
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	0
We almost bailed then, but we were really hungry and Asian food sounded good.	
Let me first say that i had never before had a bad experience at a Wynn resort.	
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.	1
The restaurant was really crowded and small.	
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.	1
I will recommend you make reservations and come with a healthy appetite!	
The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.	0
The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.	0
I had heard that Bonsai was one of the better choices in town and after passing on Broughton Street, thought i'd give it a go.	
Usually we don't order the 'Dinner for ___' at Asian restaurants, but this one is not to be overlooked!	
The calamari looked like scrawny chicken strips and tasted like a flavorless, rubbery, unknown protein dipped in batter.	
I give it 2 thumbs down	0
Our waitress then asked our party if everyone's steak was cooked to their liking but she said it in a tone, a tone like "UGH F%^&, ANYONE ELSE??"	
Antelope: almost too gamey for my liking, but quite good.	
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	0
My fianc√© and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.	1
), Baked Scallop Shell (Not bad at all, oily of course as they usually are, but apparently not as oily as the Dynamite, but it was tasty.	
I definitely recommend this breakfast spot, but be prepared to wait awhile.... it is popular for a reason!	
If you're looking to start your night off with drinks before hitting the town id recommend.	
Mmm tequila.	
It was exactly that.	
Wife and I had hors d'oeuvres at the bar.	
The owner is nice and, though a little hard to understand, will talk to you as he prepares you food.	
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.	1
Cosmo...weren't you supposed to be different and awe-inspiring?	
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	0
I had the Chicken Chimichanga.	
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.	0
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!	1
I looked past that.	
All in all, between the depressing front counter and the lackluster food, you won't find me going back to this place.	
My fianc√© and I were starving.	
The new menu still does The waitresses are not carrying 67 guns, (Too expensive) not.	
... So strange... Even still though, the pad Thai tasted way better than my red curry.	
And if you want to know why I'm raving it's because yes they are slow and I'm going to be bummed if they close.	
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.	1
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.	1
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.	1
Granted we ordered a number of different items - for variety and sufficiency - we figured our dinner bill would be a little pricey.	
My bf always gets the miso broth.	
The waitresses came around, who were pretty nice, and asked for our drinks.	
Okay, folks, I'm a condiment lover.	
We went for hookah and a light meal with low expectations.	
this place is good.	1
The wings were pretty hot for medium, way hotter than the menu let on.	
Hint: If you need to sit on the floor to rest while you're waiting in line for a buffet, you shouldn't be waiting in line for a buffet.	
Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.	0
It is Very disappointing that this establishment would turn down customers.	
I had the chicken bryan and it was delish as were the garlic mashed potatoes that had the ice cream scoop shape.	
Unfortunately when she received her bill, they charged her $1 for each slice of avocados and she didn't realize it until she received her bill.	
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.	0
There was definitely a perceptible difference in service to people of the brown leaning as compared to the paler people.	
We had one waiter and it seemed that he had no help for 12 people.	
I was seated immediately.	1
Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.	1
For dessert, I had their profiteroles and this was a much better representation of a classic French dish.	
Sitting on the street side patio offers great people watching opportunities.	
$9 for potstickers seems a bit much.	
I had to do a three-point turn just to pull out of the angled spot!	
Way too small for a place like this, with only about five seats.	
Yep that is the ticket.	
not milk with chocolate syrup:) even though i like it too.	
Food was ok nothing to brag about.	
I do not however go to restaurants solely to be treated nicely but instead I go for the food.	
She asks us if we want the burgers remade.	
I get the number ten, eye of round and brisket pho, if you like your eye of round rare just ask they can bring it out on the side.	
Avoid at all cost!	0
I was at Little Budda at Palms and also Sushi Roku at Caesar's and those places were 100xs better than Japonais.	
He's comfortable, that much is true, because I know him well.	
Pink Lotus is closed for business.	
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.	1
When the check arrived, I was shocked to see the Manager had CHARGED us for both sets of dumplings - the ones we ordered and the ones we had not.	
Nope, sorry, out of crab mac and cheese.	
DELICIOUS!!	1
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.	1
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...	0
My girlfriend said she would prefer a place with more of an "atmosphere."	
As a third generation hillbilly once removed, I am always on the look out for good biscuits and gravy.	
We waited for about an hour and a half for our tables, which was understandable because they were busy and there was a lot of us.	
When I asked how the person that just came got a table, he just repeated that he was very busy.	
Just wish it wasn't in Henderson.	
I've never been treated so bad.	0
Did I just visit on an off day or did the all-you-can eat menu change the way these previously delicious dishes were prepared?	
Bacon is hella salty.	1
Despite the above I am not a complainer as I look forward to time out with my friends, good food and service.	
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.	0
It all got sorted out but shouldn't have happened in the first place.	
I concurred, but I figured I could just chase the bites down with sips of my delicious cappuccino.	
*FRIED PICKLES* I've loved everything i've had so far...just wish the food came out faster :)	
Where do I start?	
They were closer in texture to spaghetti.	
Requirement 2 - relishes PASS - Tornado serves proper relishes (carrots, celery, olives, onions, radishes, etc) threaded on skewers in an iced glass.	
This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.	1
When they finally did bring out the food, they had dropped my meal so I had to wait another 15 minutes before I could eat.	
The waitresses are very friendly.	1
Hungry barefooted girls in line and drunk guys talking to themselves.	
Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!	1
About 5 minutes later someone else brought us our entrees.	
the meat wasn't bad, but it should have had a little more flavor to it.	
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.	1
Naan: A little bit too much cilantro, but pretty damn tasty regardless, like Naan should always be.	
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.	0
I wasn't disappointed.	
So we rushed through our food and got outta there since they did not want us to linger.	
Seasoning of the gravy was pretty good, the description said there was garlic, did not taste a bit of garlic.	
We sat in the dining room and looked over the menu.	
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.	0
Wish we hadn't.	
I'm a fan of Hubert from TV.	
I'm not too big of a fan of Crabs.	
Where's the dark rum?	
If you're staying at Caesars Palace, it's always open and even during slow times, the Cafe still gets moderate traffic.	
Here's the deal.	
I should have gotten a slice of pizza because the wait was killing me.	
Overall I'd say they are right between "Meh" and "Good".	
Went here based off yelp reviews and it was delicious!	
When we asked the food runner about it, he said everything was "family style".	
If I'm with someone, we will usually also get the gyoza, which are good but nothing special.	
It was still delicious and this time I had sampled the banana and pumpkin bread.	
This is the first and definitely the last time I will visit this buffet.	
In the sitting area they have a huge loveseat that is broke down needs to be taken to the dump with it's caved in seating and filthy cloth.	
The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.	1
Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.	1
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.	0
He didn't think the meat (what little there was) was very good either.	
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.	0
Expect the price here to be a buck or two more than the truck is on the regular.	
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.	0
It's not hard to get this wrong.	
We also ordered sides of mushrooms, mashed potatoes, and sauteed brocolli.	
*MOUTH DROOLS* The lady up front is very nice too and I liked that they had tables outside!	
This could possibly make you skip back to my car after having one or two or three!	
He really is a great people-person.	
For dinner they include two different sashimi orders on their All You Can Eat menu.	
All that said 3 of us was $ 130.00 of utter slop.	
The staff was extremely slow and didn't think about the next step at any time.	
Is it part of the French attitude?	
Discuss.....	
The server greeted us at our table with a fresh house made bread selection of onion, olive bread and rustic chibatta loaf.	
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!	0
It was probably dirt.	0
We had rush though our meal, when we finally got it.	
But this drink... Oh man.	
I do not think that the management ever eats there, or else they would have to know that they are sub par!	
He said the burger was huge....It wasn't, he also said the fries were awesome!	
Then we walked inside... Flies!	
Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.	1
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.	1
If you're considering going to Masto's, that means you're likely considering other high-end restaurants like Prime, Cut, Craftsteak etc.	
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	0
Interesting decor.	1
So, there were 4 of us and we decided to get 2 dishes and split it.	
What I really like there is the crepe station.	1
i had the gnocchi and my husband had the scallops.	
Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.	1
I used to work nearby, and after a 2 year hiatus, returned for dinner.	
The only major con was that there was only one lady and one little counter.	
But, gee, I must've been the only one who was thinking about the meat inside the folds of those tacos after we left.	
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)	1
They do need to space out the servings though.	
If a restaurant lets me order it, I can review it as is.	
At a $65 price tag for the tasting menu for dinner - it's a steal really!	
I told her we only ordered 2 dishes and that they had made a mistake.	
Pricey lunch but we ordered too much.	
And he took the plate without saying anything.	
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.	1
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.	0
Buffalo Wings or Wads?	
We asked if there was a Thai chef and were told to order a Thai dish and judge for ourselves (ie "no").	
I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.	1
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	0
oh oh oh It's worth a go-oh!	
The food: We went around 6:00 on a Friday and they were out of chicken and ribs.	
The Server again spoke with the Manager about our decision to leave.	
The first time, I politely told one lady I was already in line before her; she apologized.	
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!	1
Every table to our right, (bar was to our left) had spotlights above their tables so they could see what they were eating.	
Bonus points for the old-timey neon out front.	
The live music on Fridays totally blows.	0
However, I did hope that they would have some creative toppings and sauce choices such as maybe a blue cheese crumbles or sauce.	
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	0
1 time what we ordered and what we got were not even close.	
Very friendly staff.	1
I came here for some french fries, a few Snack Wraps (grilled and fried Ranch and Honey Mustard, thank you) and for a fucking Mocha Iced Coffee.	
Chelsea's emailed me after my first review and asked for additional feedback.	
It is worth the drive.	1
I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.	1
Food was great and so was the serivce!	1
We all ordered our pies a la mode.	
The warm beer didn't help.	0
Great brunch spot.	1
Service is friendly and inviting.	1
Very good lunch spot.	1
My husband ordered the trout (not something that he would usually order but wanted something different), with mashed potatoes and vegetables.	
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.	0
That was fine by us.	
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.	0
BUT if you keep your eyes out, there's often deals for locals.	
I didn't mention this before, but it was not busy in there at all!	
Portions are quite large...my bento had several moist pieces of salmon teriyaki, just lightly brushed with sauce.	
Must have been an off night at this place.	0
An inviting place, but the food is just so-so.	
The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.	1
The inside looks like a "countrified", "western" place.	
We'll he doubled check and it was the replacement for the one on the current list, my comment "Sold".	
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.	0
No one checked on us for refills or if we needed anything.	
For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.	0
Although they did offer after awhile of seein my daughters mouth on fire to tame them down.	
The food was pretty decent, but the prices were absolutely ******RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	
Hopnot IPA is a really good IPA Peach Ale is good for a sweeter beer or female	
Be warned these noodles are slurpy and you will get the collagen rich stock all over your clothes if you're not careful.	
My friend loved the salmon tartar.	1
*It appears as if Yama is expanding, There was a sign on the door that said they will be closed on June 10, & 11.	
Won't go back.	0
Extremely Tasty!	1
That's right: no ketchup, no tartar sauce, nothing.	
They do not overload the sushi with rice like many other AYCE places do.	
Waitress was good though!	1
Restaurant accepts cash, visa or mastercard (no personal checks) and they offer a catering menu.	
My favorite is butterscotch.	
good salsa mild and hot chips are good, but could be warm.	
Soggy and not good.	0
Both times I have been so far has been on a weekend for late lunch.	
I'm not sure if it's more restaurant, or more club.	
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.	1
Which are small and not worth the price.	0
This bar is based more on looks rather than authenticity of Sushi.	
- the food is rich so order accordingly.	1
Ok, maybe the ice ran out, they're busy.	
The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!	0
The service was a bit lacking.	0
Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.	0
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.	0
It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.	0
We came here for our parting meal... a bit of a brunch, I suppose.	
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.	1
So for 2 people without a significant amount of food or drinks we ended up paying over 1$$ which is ridiculous for a pub.	
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!	1
Also there's not outdoor patio, as you'll have to go back downstairs to the restaurant or exit the club to get any fresh air.	
One of the best things about this place is the friendly, kind people who own/work at this restaurant.	
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.	1
As for the "mains," also uninspired.	0
Came here and sat down right away.	
Patrick's Day in 2009.	
Ended up costing around $50 including tax and tip.	
The crepes were pretty good so I put up with the treatment for about five visits.	
The 1-thing?	
I didn't like the clam steamer flavor, they had some kind of Italian seasoning on top, like oregano?	
I responded with "why are there no good Mexican food restaurants in Tempe?"	
I really like how they smoosh up the Kalamata olives so that the little crushed pieces are splattered all over the pizza.	
This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!	1
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.	1
If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.	0
Very very fun chef.	1
You are already getting your meal comped!	
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.	0
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.	1
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.	0
The descriptions said "yum yum sauce" and another said "eel sauce", yet another said "spicy mayo"...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.	0
I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).	1
The mozzarella was extremely fresh but it was overwhelming with all the tomatoes in it.	
All tables occupied, loud music bumping, and servers running around.	
It's nothing fancy, frilly or Scottsdale...it's casual and comfortable.	
And unfortunately, that continually seems to be the basis with which a restaurant is judged in this town.	
I'm sure many vegetarians who eat there probably feel the same way.	
Of course, the only reason we had a menu was cause they were on the table, not because we were EVER greeted.	
It was a chicken stew flavored with walnuts and pomegranate.	
Hmm, not really sold on this as a good place to have a drink.	
The sea bass that my dad had was flavorful, but I'm a bigger fan of red meat.	
The owner said he didn't know.	
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.	0
I mean, it can't be that much.	
Plenty of TVs inside will make this a great place to be for games,(but still classy enough us ladies will want to come with).	
about another 10 - 15 minutes passed before we got our nachos.	
Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.	1
Now that we found the wine club I may be here quite a bit more often.	
Julie and Mike were super nice and made my girlfriend and I feel welcome on our first visit to Mr Mama's.	
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.	0
I thought I would try serendipity for dessert since it is quite popular and the idea of a frozen hot chocolate is interesting.	
Even on a Sunday night, there were hardly any table to spare, including the outside balcony area.	
Now this dish was quite flavourful.	1
The whole thing was smothered in cheese that could have stood to be melted a little more.	
When I read about this sandwich on-line it said it had crispy tofu strips, so I guess I just assumed it would be hot.	
Coming in, we were asked to wait for about 20 minutes to be seated.	
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.	0
(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.	0
like the other reviewer said "you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."	0
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.	0
Frankly, It shouldnt have anything on the menu over $27.	
I'll admit, even I took a second glance at the clean-shaven stud that took especially careful care of the ladies... and gents, in our group.	
I Yelp Wendy's and find this one is one just around the corner from where I'm staying.	
Seriously flavorful delights, folks.	1
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.	1
We came here on a Friday night with high hopes with great recommendations from friends.	
Don't worry; the M's got your tongue.	
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.	1
We were attending a matinee at the symphony and arrived 1.5 hours before and went to the restaurant, there was already a 45 minute wait.	
I had the Hunan Chicken and an Egg Roll.	
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.	0
There were some definite pros and cons to this restaurant.	
Owner's are really great people.!	1
They have a band that plays and a DJ to play when the band is taking a break.	
We ordered the octopus sushi and the octopus is no longer in it's fresh pink-red color and has been turned into gray.	
Now, that's a different kind of virgin that I've heard of!	
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.	0
We then ordered 3 dishes, Osso Buco (special), Linguine with sea food combo, and chicken marsala with linguine.	
Salad...The caesar salad was tasty in the end, but the presentation was odd.	
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.	1
The only good part of the breakfast was the bacon.	
Cute decor, warm and friendly wait staff, and great food.	
I am sory Surang's Thai, you are not for me.	
Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.	0
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.	1
I feel like this is a less well-know restaurant, at least for the average Madison diner.	
The mac and cheese was average.	
I had the Rib Plate, mac n cheese and coleslaw.	
On top of that the sushi chef gave my family a dirty look for voicing our concerns with the food.	
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.	1
We went here for my birthday during Restaurant Week.	
Plus I got two ice creams.	
Boyfriend ordered the falafel sandwich ($5.25) and yam chips($1.99), I ordered the mushroom/halume pita ($6.50) with zucchini fritters ($2.99).	
Teriyaki chicken - This is more like a sweet soy sauce chicken.	
On to the food stuff... Our party of 8 ordered two bowls of chips to start the evening...at $5.95 a bowl!	
I always enjoy a sqaure deal, and today was no exception.	
I eventually received coffee refills after throwing dirty looks at the young waitress who brags about also working at the Hard Rock steakhouse.	
Fantastic service here.	1
I called and bring it to their manager's attention.	
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.	0
The salmon sushi and sashimi were VERY good although portions were small.	
They know how to make them here.	1
very tough and very short on flavor!	0
First with the good.	
Entrees: Dover sole - covered in dry, crusty bread crumbs, couldn't even taste the fish, and the broccolinis were mostly hard stem pieces.	
This is a little odd but I really liked that they gave a whole dill pickle slice for the pickle.	
I hope this place sticks around.	1
Plus affordable prices?	
We paid for our food and got it to go and ended up giving it to a homeless guy on mill.	
I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.	0
The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.	1
It wasn't even during peak hours, they clearly don't ever clean up until closing time.	
They didn't even have to make anything for me.	
No room for dessert.	
I've been here many times as it is right down the road from my neighborhood.	
Can't wait!	
But this place is just not good any more.	
Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!	1
Decent casual atmosphere.	
In the past I have been treated well and with respect.	
And don't say restaurant Mexico!	
I'll say this... they should seriously consider selling the chili as a chili bowl separate.	
Just bam, in your face.	
By the power of Yelp, we found something off-the-beaten-path that only the locals know about and a few tourists willing to venture out here.	
- Sexy cocktails - Fabulous ambiance Cons: - My trout had too much lemon and I was too drunk to have the presence of mind to send it back.	
The servers are friendly, but a little aloof.	
Both were great.	
The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.	1
Wildfish is right off of Camelback Rd, around the corner from South Bridge in Scottsdale.	
For the discerning beef eater, there is a featured heart brand akaushi filet for $78, or snake river farms qagyu rib eye for $62.	
Plus, it's only 8 bucks.	1
We ordered a fillet of steak, clam chowder, duet of lamb, Mac and cheese and asparagus.	
We were not happy, but what could we do?	
The service was not up to par, either.	0
Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time.	1
The packaging needs improvement.	
No complaints about the service, and the veggies in the limited salad bar were fresh enough.	
Good luck having a conversation at a normal level.	
The food was good but not enough for me to go back again.	
They obviously did the restaurant.com deals to drum up business (it was nearly empty in there) and that is how they treat us?	
Both rolls tasted very 'fishy' which should never be the case.	
Guacamole came out with the meal- blamed on kitchen for the mistake.	
Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!	1
For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.	0
), but this is obviously a classic tourist trap for overpriced food (and they go beyond what is overpriced!)	
when we pointed this out to the waitress she did not seem surprised at all, on top of that she made no effort to get rid of it or kill it.	
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!	1
Food was good, but I would spend my money somewhere else.	
The mo-hawk guy shrugs his shoulders and the manager walks away.	
I settled for an FP 8th street Ale.	
The remodel looks like it's going to be very schwanky too once it's complete in November.	
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.	1
It was very noisy but aesthetically pleasing.	
Kevin O'Donnell is from the Texas Hold'em family of final tables and occasionally will play the tour.	
You can't beat that.	1
I'm not the douchebag here, buddy.	
Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.	1
The good food is gone.	
The chefs were friendly and did a good job.	1
We go to the Earl and get our sandwiches, I just ordered a simple ham and cheese and it blew my socks off.	
If you've got the budget to blow and want a smart, nonfussy (or snobby) wine bar to chill at... this might be worth a look.	
I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.	0
I guess it just wasn't for me.	
I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.	1
The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!	1
I think not again	0
I would have rather had Golden Corral.	
Since there were several of us dining that evening, we ordered pizzas across the menu and shared family style.	
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.	0
I'm allergic to onion.	
The dip was spinachy enough, but mundane.	
But whatevs, all looks the same in the end right?	
How on earth can you screw up a pulled pork sandwich-twice!	
as I always do, I had a craving for sandwiches and decided to try a new place to order sandwiches from in the area.	
They took the bags away, called the managers and confirmed it's just a sea creature that sometimes doesn't get filtered out.	
The Reuben sandwich lunch was half that.	
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.	1
Service stinks here!	0
That is the Welcome Diner.	
Well I'll say one thing from the get go, they named this place perfectly.	
Drive somewhere else vs.	
I waited and waited.	0
The lunch was unexpectedly rushed due largely to my inability to find a parking spot (oops!)	
The Grilled Chicken was kind of bland in my opinion.	
Anyone wanna buy it?	
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.	0
first, i dont eat rolls!	
My brother was ecstatic as can be when he first took a bite of this shaved ice.	
Bathrooms are forever away, passing by the back-of-house restaurant rooms on the way.	
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.	1
Great Pizza and Salads!	1
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.	0
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.	0
This place is amazing!	1
The mock turkey they use is divine and the coleslaw & Russian dressing are so tasty!	
Our group went with the seafood combination, which consisted of lobster tails, giant shrimps, calamari, and scallops.	
This is the second time in 2 months this has happened on different days.	
The dates were sweet and melted in your mouth, offset by the crunchy bacon and almonds, the sharp blue cheese, and the savory red wine sauce.	
You get the point.	
I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.	0
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!	0
Just don't know why they were so slow.	0
*Gave them two hours advance notice we had a party of 20, still waited 25 min.	
They are worth the $$.	
What's all the hype?	
The Garlic Garlic Shrimp had 9 good sized shrimp with the tails on served on a bed of raw cabbage.	
The upkeep of the interior could use some work.	
I initially said I wanted to get the all you can eat and then asked leaned that most of what I wanted to order was on the a la cart menu.	
Alberto was fun and made great martinis.	
The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.	1
It was tasty but not outstanding.	
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.	0
I was so impressed with the sister restaurant in New Orleans that I opted to make a reservation here for hubby's bday.	
I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.	1
You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.	1
So I was totally worried that Lolo's wouldn't live up to the hype.	
It has all the ingredients but comes up short time and again.	
It was initially served in one dish, as opposed to 2 in the past, and the amount of marinara was barely covered the top of the eggplant.	
The pretentious menu, the "Denny's" environment.	
If you get the chance to have Albert wait on you, it will be a pleasure.	
Seat promptly - then waited.	
(: Ordered the quesadilla appetizer.	
It was still breakfast time according to their posted menu ("till 11 a.m.").	
Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.	0
The restaurant dining area echoed on the inside, which made for an interesting experience.	
I went here as part of a ginormous 30-person party and everything went pretty smoothly considering our group's size.	
Sadly our own waiter wasn't aware of this hitch because he never came near our table that whole time.	
You have to eat here when you have time late at night and are craving some Japanese flair.	
I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.	1
The omelettes look more like accidents than exquisitely prepared dishes.	
When I go to the one in central Phoenix they have my sandwich ready by the time I fill my drink.	
Never again will I be dining at this place!	0
The food was excellent and service was very good.	1
Pity that I overlooked that when it mattered!	
It's hard to find Chinese food cooked for Chinese and not the american palette.	
But fret not, my friend, for once the goods are placed before you, you can't help but forget the agony you endured waiting for it.	
A manager came up and yelled at the poor hostess in front of us.	
They're busy at lunchtime.	
The food is okay, but the server wont refill you until you ask.	
A total of 8 orders for two people came to a little more than $17.	
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.	1
I will DEFINITELY come here again.	
Lobster was like rubber) For such and expensive dish, blah and not worth the price tag(s).	
No waiting at this McDonalds.	
The onions and cilantro was fresh and the salsa was tangy.	
She didn't try to sell us anything, talk about the craft beers, or pretend that we were helping to pay her check in any way, So we ordered.	
We ordered drinks and I was a little overwhelmed by the large cocktail menu.	
If you don't know what you like- you can grab a slice of every meat to sample, then pile your plate with your faves.	
A manager came over and said they were trying to improve their menu.	
We had a ground level room with a sliding glass door facing the parking lot and a busy street.	
People seem to love this place, but for me, I got a very "corporatized" feel from my first impression.	
Beware!!!!!!	
It was a little expensive but what do you expect for a steak house in Vegas.	
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.	0
You can't fake happy for that long!	
This is my go-to Chinese place.	
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.	0
I like this new location compared to the old one BC parking is convenient and the restaurant is larger but still quaint.	
Food was really boring.	0
Good Service-check!	1
I don't think it would have been a big deal to throw some veg into the juicer, but she preferred to turn away a customer.	
The salad was a handful of greens a pinch of cuc's and tomatoes.	
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!	0
I've been to numerous steak houses throughout the country and not one comes close!!	
Will never, ever go back.	0
As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.	0
Then I proceeded to order the Duck Lo Mein.	
Service was also commendable.	
The food is good so the fun vibe is just icing.	
I like the vegetarian cheese burger but I don't eat cheese so I ask for it without the cheese.	
Every time we go to Vegas, we make sure to hit this place up at least once for breakfast.	
In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.	1
We waited another 20 minutes before being seated.	
I did not expect this to be so good!	1
Fantastic food!	1
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.	0
The Big Apple now serves breakfast all day long, focuses on buying local, and the breakfast menu is very good.	
They discounted our food, not our drinks.	
The food was very good.	1
I can't say enough about the great personalized service from the food runners and hosts to the servers and management.	
Yet, when pressed, they still wouldn't reveal whether their "cola" was Coke, Pespi, or something else (some of us care, yo).	
They started learning our names.	
Went for lunch and ordered the lunch special sweet and sour pork, it also came with egg drop soup, eggroll, and a drink.	
My only complaint would be that the melon that came on the side was a big slice that still had the rind on it.	
I've seen food we ordered given away right in front of me, and then watched the new batch sit for many minutes before anyone decided to bag it up.	
I was starving and i wasn't craving anything while i was walking down Downtown Las Vegas.	
Anyways, I heard beforehand they paid about $15 per person (25 people, you do the math) and read Yelp reviews on the place.	
Never going back.	0
There's no doubt they're busy, which is why at times your order can be a little bit slow.	
I went there with three of my coworkers while we were in Las Vegas.	
Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.	1
before any waiters acknowledged us.	
We got a Voucher to the buffet, decided to use it for breakfast thinking that people can't really screw up breakfast...and I was wrong!	
I was injured walking into Calico Jack's because of their negligence.	
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.	0
We also shared the Local Roasted Cauliflower.	
My only issue was a small one.	
By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.	0
I promptly, with a heavy heart and sad tummy, told the waitress about the dirt.	
Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.	1
Haven't been here since they've changed management.	
And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.	1
I was honestly more excited about drinks and dessert, so I didn't order an actual "meal."	
They came with chorizo which was minced and sprinkled over the mussels.	
The chicken madras, vindaloo or hurri mirchi are my favourites however this is one of the few places I have enjoyed the milder creamier curries from.	
This plate is so big you can easily split it w someone.	
So I ordered a regular ketchup and all I could say think was I want some Heinz dangit!	
We got there about 7PM on a Friday night... and the place was really dead.	
I'm not sure if it's even open for business.	
All the bread is made in-house!	1
The only downside is the service.	0
Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.	0
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.	1
A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.	1
I usually order take out from here when we are not in the mood to cook dinner.	
There's a huge menu of hot drinks, shots, blended drinks, and of course, anything iced.	
Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!	1
It was a lovely meal, lovely building, but it was not relaxing.	
Don't get me wrong, I like spicy food but if I order something I expect to get what I paid for.	
The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!	1
They also agreed to some of my special requests... so.	
We've had China Mama on our list for a few months and finally made it over there last week.	
When it initially opened I gave it three stars.	
Very similar to Ted's in Tempe.	
The Bun Rieu is in the $9.00 range but the flavor and ingredients are top notch.	
The standouts for us were the "Monkey Cakes" which were very nicely cooked pancakes with bananas and slivered almonds in the batter, very yummy!	
You won't be disappointed.	1
They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.	1
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.	0
All no dairy or chicken broth used, vegaterian vegan friendly.	
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.	0
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.	0
We brought it to the attention of the gal taking orders, and were offered a replacement (pass) but no refund.	
I love coming here for a late night snack... carna asada flatbread & a stella~!I love the Western theme...they didsuch a good job!	
The blueberry muffin I had to go with it didn't hurt my feelings either.	
I just wish they would open a place near the Biltmore where I live.	
Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.	1
We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere.	1
What deserves 3-4 stars: - The frites and classic mayo dipping sauce are absolutely delicious.	
Drive out of your way to find a Long John Silvers you will be way better off.	
However, when it arrived it didn't have grilled onions, as advertised.	
I'll save my Omakase dollars for Austin's Uchi.	
They run around looking so busy.. But I seriously don't see them doing anything.. And the food here is just plain horrible!	
No wonder this place is always packed, people are mesmerized by fire.	
Everything was gross.	0
There were plenty of open table.	
I love this place.	1
Great service and food.	1
And even though I'm close to senility, I eventually realized that it wasn't me!	
Drop the prices to $5 and at least get some cash flow going and people in the doors, even if you'll take a loss.	
Maybe we resembled someone he hated.	
First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!	0
Ok, maybe that's the norm...it was still good, not the best I've had but ok.	
The burger... I got the "Gold Standard" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.	0
This is a real Hash House with several different kinds of hash!!	
OMG, the food was delicioso!	1
And "Urban Spoon"- get busy!	
In regards to the meat, it's comparable to any wonderful steakhouse I've ever been to.	
Even when we were completely come eating we could not find her.	
There is nothing authentic about this place.	0
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.	0
Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.	1
PS - Try a sandwich on the house-made bread they have.	
I finally noticed a guy sitting inside.	
Since we were in Vegas, we gotta save money somehow right?	
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.	1
Florindinos is more authentic	
The food itself was fine, even good.	
It's worth driving up from Tucson!	1
Ordered a wine and beer and an antipasti plate.	
My wife and I had heard about this place and about their happy hour (Revive @ 5) menu.	
The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.	0
Pretty good beer selection too.	1
There are not a ton of selections, which I hope meant that the ones they did have were really good.	
This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.	1
Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!	1
5 stars for the brick oven bread app!	1
It might have been a one time thing, or maybe the guy didn't notice.	
I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.	1
Sausage was gross, brisket average, prime rib rubbery and bland and the lamb chop was average.	
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.	0
I have to admit, my expectations were lowered after reading several of the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised.	
I thought there wasn't enough sauce, so I asked for more sauce, but the sauce was very thin and watery, and just lacked flavor.	
After the meal we let Travis know again that we would like a box for the pot stickers and that we still NEVER got our spring rolls.	
The sweet potato fries could have standed to be crunchier, but the flavor was there and the sandwich was quite tasty.	
I kept coming back thinking that maybe with the changes eventually stuff would work itself out and get back to normal.	
He was terrible!	0
Everyone is treated equally special.	1
It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.	0
It was delicious!!!	1
Not at all what I have come to expect from this place.	
On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.	1
The only one who ate the food was my husband, who said it was o.k.	
So I was under the impression that when you use the urinal, that is what you are allegedly drinking if you order draft beer.	
Extra sour cream, $1.00.	
The grilled octopus with broccoli raabi was tasty and nicely cooked, but could have been better seasoned.	
My ex is more familiar with japanese dishes so I let her do the ordering and I do the eating.	
I learned the building was originally a department store.	
Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.	0
Next stop was the carving line.	
T was smiling the whole time while eating it, but was unable to finish the large portion, so that was destined to be her lunch the next day.	
Had a better 6.00 dollar burger at a famous fast food chain.	
2) The food cannot really be called that.	
We've been coming here since '07.	
As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!	1
I had to dissect my wrap in order to remove bits of bacon and could taste it in every bite.	
Best fish I've ever had in my life!	1
I could not get beyond the oddness of this one.	
The highlight of the experience was the Michelada I ordered with Modelo Especial which was made perfectly.	
I tried this place based on a recommendation of a co-worker.	
After much hype about the lobster club, we went for lunch last weekend.	
(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)	1
We won't be returning, which is sad because we think the atmosphere is one of the best in the west valley.	
Apparently they have a HUGE soccer following..we were there in January.	
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.	0
I must say that Walking Stick Resort and Casino is truly impressive and Wandering Horse is definitely deserving of its place here.	
Dont understand the rating food was very average.	
Make a reservation!	
This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.	1
This round was by far the best part of our visit to this establishment.	
The free pops were also appreciated.	
Pretty cool I would say.	1
$8.99 is nothing in comparison to the prices at Stir Crazy in Illinois and other similar concepts, but I guess ignorance is bliss.	
My favorite was always Wednesday night soup with their Chicken Enchilada Soup, but they have changed it somehow.	
Amazing food, and I wish it was a little closer to me so I could go there on my lunch breaks at work.	
I drank 3 bottles of it..... in 2 hours.	
Lon's is not a bad restaurant....its simply not the excellent gem it once was :( 1) Only 1 chocolate dish on the dessert menu.	
But not today.	
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.	0
At this point we had a long day and were over the experience.	
I won't avoid this place for a normal dining experience based on today, but I will pass when it comes to a sporting event that I really want hear.	
Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.	1
We ordered the plantain spring rolls with mango chutney.	
We did find out they have loaner sport coats, how wonderful.	
DJ points to his screen.	
I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.	0
And compared to the SF restaurant, this place was a real bargain...heh heh, which I know isn't saying much.	
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.	0
Even though that is the correct portion size, I guess you are just so used to seeing huge slabs of meat when you order steak!	
Service was nice but not particularly warm or anything.	
Well after being out of the country for quite some time, my sister and I wanted some real Italian food.	
So, onto the actual reason of Topgolf: Golf games!	
Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.	1
Green's success lies in the adage that some people will eat ANYTHING.	
Instead it's quite light, with a fair amount of TVs.	
Came here after watching "O" just down the hall and all I can say is WOW (to Fix, not the crazy Cirque du Soleil show).	
The staff are great, the ambiance is great.	1
Looking around, it looks like they have live entertainment to perform here and there.	
All night, I was determined to have a good time, dammit.	
In fact, I really enjoyed the staggering of appetizers so that I could enjoy each one individually.	
He deserves 5 stars.	1
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.	0
I was floored at the bad reviews when I truly thought it was delicious.	
Did we get a lot of chips?	
We ordered the Calamari for an appetizer and my boys loved it.	
Pulled pork sliders.	
They dropped more than the ball.	0
The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.	1
By the time we got out of there it was almost 11:00 and the mall the restaurant is located in was closed.	
They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!	1
Scenery isn't much to look at, but who's griping when you can play year round?	
Less hassle for us and more time to have a chat.	
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.	0
We decided to go with the ahi tuna appetizer.	
I usually don't write about chains unless I feel really strongly about it.	
I'll stick to five guys.	
Best tacos in town by far!!	1
I took back my money and got outta there.	0
In an interesting part of town, this place is amazing.	1
Drink though can get a bit pricy.	
She finally waved down the other bartender, I forget his name, i think gene or something, for assistance.	
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.	0
So when I ran my card I was pretty baffled that meal totaled over $15 bucks!	
My favorite would be the brisket, which is what I always get in my pho.	
The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.	0
Pretty decent for a small coffeehouse/eatery.	
I won't be back.	0
They have great dinners.	1
Nearly everything that came out was drenched in citrus, which overpowered the fish.	
This was my first time eating here (March 10, 2014) I had some friends just get in from Cali that I had not seen in 25 years.	
The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.	1
Went to kitchen to inspect pizza.	
TGI Friday's?	
The food was terrible.	0
They were so quick to drop the check off.	
Steamed Chicken - We asked for the chilled version, but it came out warm.	
Not cheap by any stretch of the imagination but a great experience nonetheless.	
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.	0
I also snuck in some creamed spinach on the side, mainly because I love the stuff, and it didn't disappoint here.	
The Teppan Yaki with the owner is FANTASTIC.	
We ordered about 12 pieces.	
I opted for the sausage/pepperoni slice.	
The cheese puffers they bring in the beginning are delectable and a perfect introduction to the food.	
Please send me back!	
Some kind of yellow tail sushi roll - (2 stars).	
Most likely not.	
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.	0
I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.	1
The food was amazing, but we will no longer be catering our business lunches with this restaurant.	
For $12 dollars it's a lot of food.	
All I can say about this is the food is mediocre, and the place isn't classy enough to be a wine bar.	
It's a sandwich, kids.	
Food: portions are big (again, better for groups!)	
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.	0
I went for lunch.	
The wait time between courses was not paced weil.	
Keeps shit edgy.	
If you go, I promise you will like...	
You know it's a good thing when there's a lineup, constantly throughout the day.	
Sit down and wait 10mins for server or anyone to approach us.	
Never had a heard a good thing about this place, I went here on a Wednesday night with some friends because I wanted to check it out.	
Our server seemed very rushed and distracted, but at no point in time during our meal was she bad enough to really make us take notice.	
Sitting outdoors under the string lights and German beer flags just made you thirsty for beer!	
This is a disgrace.	0
Def coming back to bowl next time	1
If you want a great steakhouse which is worth it's weight in gold, go to Hugo's Cellar at Four Queens or Hank's at Green Valley Ranch.	
The 3rd member of our party did throughly enjoy his short ribs.	
We only oder 4 waters and a small sake for myself.	
We also planm to let everyone we know about this.	
If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place.	1
I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area (;	1
I didn't have high expectations to start with being in an airport and all.	
He came back and said that the pad Thai was for the other table, because they ordered chicken and we ordered beef.	
Though it's still pricey, it's worth every cent.	
I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.	1
Unfortunately there was a serious language barrier so I'm not sure he understood what had happened other than a customer was majorly pissed.	
Of course we tip at any restaurant, why wouldn't we?	
We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.	1
She doesn't reply and just adds the extra to my total.	
For starters, it's a good thing they have flavored waters, because their regular water tasted funky.	
Acting all haughty.	
Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.	1
This should have been a warning of how things were to be... The second time, we decided to stay for dinner.	
To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.	1
Arrived on a Sunday around 12:15pm and it took less than 5 minutes to get in through the "Invited Guests" line.	
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.	0
As soon as we were settled chips, salsa, and refried beans appeared before us.	
We liked that the bar was separate from the restaurant and that we could hear ourselves talk.	
SERVICE: 0/5 Hated it, Deal breaker ATMOSPHERE: 3/5 Nice, dim and calm.	
Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!	1
Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.	1
I saw someone uploaded a picture of their Burglary sign in August but this was definitely not the same sign.	
Your won't miss me, because you are always busy.	
Drink menu was on an iPad, which although cool, seemed strange.	
I had the Huaraches.	
Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.	1
It was like porn to me.	
So the method is if you see something interesting on the menu order it, for it may be gone tomorrow.	
I had to check out the place since it looked like a classic taco shack you'd find in Mexico.	
It was the most dry and chewy steak I ever ate.	
This one is simply a disappointment.	0
How about leave a bottle of sriracha out like any other restaurant?	
I like Le Village Buffet.	
Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.	0
We had actually had arepas before, in Brooklyn - they are kind of similar to the dish some parts of Mexico call a quesadilla.	
And they never do.	
I firmly believe this is a manager's job and should be done everywhere.	
A fun outing he and his family never tired of were trips to Rawhide.	
Eerder een zeer teleurstellende ervaring gehad.	
The only reason I'm not giving this rating 5 stars is because the size of the bathroom and the nosies the toilet made once it was flushed.	
When we walked in they knew who we were, they greated us so kindly, they gave us a great table where we could see the whole restaurant.	
would i come back?	
I finished my two tacos and was sad that they were over.	
First, they changed the menu and my favorite meal was not on the menu.	
Saffron Flavors of India is a rarity because so few Indian restaurants are located in Northwest Las Vegas.	
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!	0
Quiznos is Quiznos as another reviewer said.	
The food is typical bar food, nothing too extraordinary, I already knew what to expect from previous visits.	
Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area.	1
If i would have known they were hosting the fight and charging, I would have chosen a different restaurant as I am not a big boxing fan.	
Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.	1
Left very frustrated.	0
I'll definitely be in soon again.	1
See my list of Phoenix's best burgers.	
Food was really good and I got full petty fast.	1
Service was fantastic.	1
We've been going to Yvonne's for years now and it used to be great.	
This was my first experience eating Ethiopian food.	
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.	0
So I ordered two tacos with potatoes, beans, tomatoes, lettuce and guacamole.	
You know, a back east kinda thing.	
Went to Marcellino with a large dinging group (about 18 people).	
YES PLEASE!	
How effed up is that???	
To start with the almond type butter in the bread basket.	
I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.	1
Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!	1
I believe the next thing was an Alaskan roll, not decent.	
No thank you Oregano's, pick-up orders beware.	
And the food at Macayo's is none of those.	
For service, I give them no stars.	0
I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.	1
The dish came with most of the traditional garnishes for com tam, but was missing the traditional egg/pork "meatloaf" that disappointed me.	
i've stayed at better hotels in the middle of nowhere...where was our coffee maker?	
And to top off the experience when I was there Rick Moonen, Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger were seating at the next table.	
The menu is huge, both in content and weight, and they have a ton of options for omnivores and vegetarians alike.	
I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.	0
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).	0
Well, I was right about one thing.	
Spent several nights in this place.	
I was told once, "There are two things that casinos don't have, clocks and mirrors".	
An aside: The view is freaking ridiculous.	
But now I was completely grossed out.	0
famous for their 24 hour specials.	
But pass on the cheese board... 3 small slices for $14.	
Some must like it the other way around.	
These people , YES THEY'RE PEOPLE TOO, deserve just as much respect as the next guy.	
First of all, let's start with the location and restaurant.	
I felt like a fish out of water here (haha get it?)	
While Voila has only been open for four months, the good newes has spread.	
Open 24/7.. but you can only get breakfast certain hours.	
I say I would like both since you are out of the taters.	
The hostess was out.	
Umm yeah had to pass on the 32 dollar strip steak special.	
I read that this place has one of the best mac-n-cheese recipes in two, so we expect to return.	
Been to many Brazilian Steakhouse, this one is slightly different.	
I really enjoyed eating here.	1
First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.	1
By the time we'd devoured the 3 dogs, there was no way we could even make a dent in the fries !	
Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.	1
From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.	1
A typical buffet.	
On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.	0
The restaurant was open and bright and coming in from triple digit heat, well-air conditioned.	
My second visit was for happy hour, and this definitely blew my expectations out of the water.	
I had a peach carbonated soda that was really good to and not too sweet.	
I came after Christmas and the restaurant is half-opened.	
The regular fries are limp and bland, the sweet potato fries are better, but too thin.	
The hostess was polite and friendly and the place looked great on first glance, very classy.	
They aren't anything like knots.	
A friend and I went here yesterday for lunch and we both got screwed on the price and change.	
Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!	0
Because you people do not care !	
I had a reasonable amount of dinner and one cosmopolitan.	
Sat for over 45 minutes after placing our order without food or drink refills.	
I highly, highly recommend making a stop at Cafe Bellagio for Sat/Sun morning breakfast or brunch.	
We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.	0
Very mixed feelings here.... the sushi is great....VERY tasty.	
Management at the Hotel was also condescending and of no help whatsoever.	
It was really good, the meat was not the best shredded beef I have ever had, but all the components together made it a taco that I would order again.	
Other notable mentions are the Arcadia Club, 1951 and Triple Lindy.	
Maybe I went on an off night...but I doubt it since this is a corporate chain the same the country over.	
What a mistake that was!	0
No complaints!	1
This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.	1
Went to dinner here w my wife for her bday.	
I had to throw the lemon aid out after one sip there was something seriously wrong with it.	
America, I'm sorry I snapped.	
But hey, I didn't and so it was delightful.	
Waiter was a jerk.	0
She loved it but has had better.	
Good for lunch combos - that's about it.	
Strike 2, who wants to be rushed.	0
Looking forward to some original chicken, while hubby wanted a double downer.	
Had another delicious meal here again.	
The food was good but not great and not what I expected from two Top Chef Masters.	
We entered on a Saturday just before 6pm.	
So busy in fact, that I still had to wait about 15 minutes before getting seated.	
Try Feast Buffet at Red Rock.	
Sorry Bollywood, catchy name but nothing to back the great time and food I thought I would have.	
Sure it's a little better than Elis Island but it's 8 Times more money!	
These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.	1
I will eat at the same five restaurants for months because I know there is something on the menu I can eat, and like.	
They acknowledged our gift card, indicated it had a $50 balance, then said that due to 'new management,' they weren't going to honor it.	
I never come again.	0
Had my first fish taco but most important they sell roger's mexican mooon shine.	
It's a cute building in a great location with friendly staff, but does not win my vote for best pizza in Phoenix, sorry!	
We took a seat out front which was nice and had a view of the bar.	
You wont find me driving out of my way to try it again though :(	
But the waiters must have been recruited from Applebees!	
We loved the biscuits!!!	1
No mention of the half of the drink order that we had to ask someone else for.	
80s music played along with their music videos on one wall.	
The flavor would've been pretty good if they hadn't put so many crunchy noodles in it.	
Kids eat free on Tuesday!	
I drive up to the window and they tell me they are out of beef!?	
Double double, protein style, animal style!	
As they say here, 'I love Sushi' and I live this place!	
So we were looking for something different in Tempe.	
Service is quick and friendly.	1
Then for the main course, we shared the soft tofu drunken noodles and sea bass entree.	
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.	0
So absolutley fantastic.	1
Not that I had a hangover.	
My husband thought that they could take some of the tables out and have it a little more roomy, but that was the only issue we could see.	
The LV Central occupies a nice looking space near the entrance across from the reception desk.	
Can we say very limited menu?	
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.	0
I thought I was going to a seafood joint.	
definitely will come back here again.	1
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.	1
I got the Prime Rib sandwich and it was incredibly small.	
Wow very spicy but delicious.	1
What I got at Le Provencal was faux Italian food that was neither tasty nor special.	
If you're not familiar, check it out.	1
I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.	0
The only good thing about this place is the location.	
A salmon roll with avocado; this was a specialty order they had no trouble making for us.	
I'd love to go back.	1
Lol I guess... On my second visit I decided to give this place another shot.	
Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch.	1
Cool bar, but it is always really busy and honestly, I don't like any of their food.	
I'll be back for the home of the crown jewel of sandwiches!	
now if we didnt have places to be we would have gone inside and ordered our food and waited.	
We had the sliders, chicken strips, green bean fries, and buffalo wings.	
This is a five star Pei Wei, if that makes sense.	
Use to love this place... Service and food have gone downhill, while prices have continued to go up.	
Nothing special.	0
Guess I will have to go again so I can give you more specifics.	
Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!	1
Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!	1
Sauces were a major issue.	
I was filled up, had energy and a balanced diet.	
the nachos were good and mama tolerated her salad.	
Will not be back.	0
From the beginning our waitor was very high strung and kept talking over me when I was asking him questions.	
Sauce was tasteless.	0
The chocolate topping was not the traditional thin dark chocolate sauce.	
The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.	1
Lychee was refreshing and with the bite of smooth, velvety shaved ice.. it was definitely a real, juicy treat.	
You figured theyd bring this stuff out as a courtesy.	
My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.	1
I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.	0
Surly old lady working the counter on my day and believe me, I caught the vibe quite clearly and won't be back.	
We also ordered fried calamari.	
We got Pork Pad Thai- spice level 4 no complaints here, was good !	
Food was so gooodd.	1
Came with mashed.	
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.	0
When I first walked in, the smell of the place already threw me off.	
Will stick with the ol standby, Four Peaks and never stray again!	
Firecracker prawns were deep fried breaded shrimp with some sauce drizzled on, really would a ramekin of sauce kill you?	
I was so insulted.	0
@ Sesame Balls - Oily, cold, goopy item.	
If you are going to serve a rolled taco, it better be a fresh corn tortilla.	
The green tea isn't that great, they use matcha powder, similar to what we used for green tea frappuccinos at Starbucks.	
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.	0
We were with a large group and we ordered wine for the whole table, which was also good.	
The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.	0
The atmosphere is somewhat lacking as the acoustics make conversation almost impossible.	
on Stephanie.	
The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc.	1
If there's any kind of a wait, even just one person ahead of you, they will let you know they'll be with you in a minute.	
Anyway, we went on a Saturday night and the place was well patronized.	
Nargile - I think you are great.	1
Best tater tots in the southwest.	1
Non problem I say and that's when the wait started There was one car in front of me at the window and the car was off.	
We loved the place.	1
It has Skyy citrus vodka, Chambord raspberry liqueur, sweet & sour, and lemon sorbet.	
Little dishes for sharing.	
Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.	0
Been here 5 times and am now leaving a review because I feel that they deserve a shout out!	
When I arrived, we were the first in line.	
If you're comfortable in this yuppie type of environment you'll more than likely enjoy it.	
She asked us if we wanted to sit in the lounge but I can assure you my 90 year old grandmother would rather sit down where we're eating.	
I got the Fish and Chips and won't be getting it again.	
It appeared no one has wiped down the area in years.	
The extra grilled jalape√±o peppers are Delish.	
The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.	1
i did forget the mention that when they would put down a plate it was like they were intentionally banging the plates on the table.	
I may disappoint some with this review because I ordered something very basic for brunch.	
Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.	1
cool paintings on the wall and very small and only a few tables available.	
So I had to pay the all you can eat price plus everything else I wanted to order.	
The manager was the worst.	0
I have been here 2 times now, only because this location is around the corner and i have yet to do a search for really good BBQ.	
We were told we were being upgraded complimentary to a King Suite.	
The inside is really quite nice and very clean.	1
The service is great; they really pay attention to your grills to make sure to clean your grill out from time to time.	
Not to mention, they have a much better happy hour.	
Slow service with an impatient waitress, however the food was good.	
The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.	1
The crust was amazingly crusty.	
Why would you staff this place with 5 people when it clearly needs more?	
Appears to be family owned.	
I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.	0
This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.	0
Love how this place is 24hours too - perfect for loading up on the carbs after a night of drinking at V Bar and Tao!	
Young female waitress was lost.	
I'm torn between one and two stars here so will give them the benefit of the doubt.	
Love the margaritas, too!	1
Eggs by Hickman's, chorizo by Schreiner's, other ingredients by local businesses and suppliers.	
We have come here for dinner in the past and for the most part have been relatively satisfied with the food.	
I wanted some pancakes and heard this is the place to go.	
we came by for lunch after checking out.	
All of this was great and the husband even ate the vegetables!	
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.	1
Very good, though!	1
There are different flavored aiolis if you are eating plain fries instead of chili cheese ones.	
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.	0
The food is just what you would expect from McDonalds.	
Great pork sandwich.	1
Nope- it came with one small wedge of pineapple ( not sweet), 15 grapes, one slice of orange, 3 black berries, 2 slices of strawberries.	
Not sure how the person above me checked in on 9/23 but this location is closed.	
My friend had the Ethiopian wine which had a smell that I wasn't use to, but was different to me.	
Don't waste your time here.	0
At 11:30 on a Saturday, other people should be on the dance floor.	
We decided to eat the side pieces of the meat and avoid the rare parts..the ribeye was actually a good piece of meat, but its hard to eat rare meat.	
Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.	0
We only ate there, because we had a conference meeting in the hotel and no time to look for food outside.	
Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.	0
First of all, PBR stands for Professional Bull Riding not Pabst Blue Ribbon.	
We enjoy their pizza and brunch.	1
I wound up getting a Pinalada smoothie and quite frankly I make way better smoothies in my blender at home.	
I read these reviews and went anyway since I had a restaurant.com coupon.	
The staff are the stars because they provide a relaxed and friendly atmosphere for your meal, very attentive but not at all overbearing.	
That might've been it actually.	
The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.	1
So I forgot a zip lock bag full of hygiene stuff.	
I might just have to eat there for lunch tomorrow before I leave.	
I am a firm believer that one review or one bad day should be the only thing to base the value of a venue on.	
Not so great on refilling our drinks or clearing our plates/finished appetizer basket.	
There are also vegetarian and vegan options for everything on the menu.	
On some occasion especially when they are busy, you might have to remind them about parts of your order.	
We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.	1
That said, I think my expectations of pizza are rising with age.	
I also love the sandwiches, but the bread was a little hard for my taste.	
When we pulled it it looks like some crummy hole in the wall pizza place.	
The only reason someone should ever go is for the entertainment factor Dick's is famous for.	
Fourth, our other friend had ordered his burger with wholewheat bun but was given a honey oat bun and, when asked, was told that it was wholewheat.	
Would I go there again?	
I had a buddy of mine pick it up for me.	
If you're visiting Pearl for a low cost and decent quality sushi, be prepared for the horrible customer service that comes with it.	
I LOVED it!	1
Second time there on Tuesday night.	
They didn't know what butter pecan ice cream was.	
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.	0
There is an occasional line (confirmation of good food) but the wait is never that long.	
Even the staff appear to be part of the spectacle, ad hoc accents all over the place.	
Chairs were uncomfortable (they were wire frames, kinda like shopping carts).	
last night my friend picked up some pies from this place and we inhaled them in just a few minutes (3) pizzas for 8 dudes....took us about 7 minutes.	
This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.	1
It isn't really worth while but the food is really delicious.	
This particular location in Tempe being connected to a Cinnabon is like a wonderful mix of greatness.	
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.	0
The selection of food was not the best.	0
Delicious and I will absolutely be back!	1
I walked in around 4 on a Saturday, expecting it to be empty which it was, with that said I would of expected better service for sitting at the bar.	
So we knew we had to go.	
The fry on the bird was good, light crisp and it had a pleasant seasoning on it where I detected a hint of cinnamon that was lovely.	
it even left me with a stomach ache the rest of the evening.	
This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.	1
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.	1
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.	0
It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.	0
How awesome is that.	1
I will be back many times soon.	1
In fact he was very well spoken and seemed at home in both Spanish and English.	
I got the chicken katsu bento box which didn't look like much, chicken katsu seemed lacking but it definitely filled me up.	
I ordered the curry and rice noodles with the shrimp.	
When we order she also ask us "lunch or dinner" portions but completely left out what the difference was.	
The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!	1
THATS NOT PORK!!	
Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.	0
Happy Hour is awesome and the Cucumber Martini is terrific!	
When we returned to the table it had been completely cleared.	
I've had pasta salads from supermarkets, italian markets on Taylor St.	
This is not your regular DIVEY Vietnamese joint.	
The screaming orgasm was decent.	
I've been craving a Taiwanese beef roll since getting back from LA.	
We walked in at 8, two hours before close, and one hostess was hunched over the counter doodling.	
This was quick - though it take her nearly 10 minutes to serve us the rewarmed pizza.	
It wasn't all out.	
CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.	1
Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.	1
He was a cool dude from the local Chevy dealership that came to pick me up to get my car.	
And then tragedy struck.	0
I'm prejudice against chains already but I just don't understand how this place stays busy.	
No arguments there.	
The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.	1
This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!	1
Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.	1
So my boyfriend goes to talk to the manager and he said the same thing.	
Shouldn't you know the dishes?	
Where did the taste go.	
after sitting for about 10 min someone finally came around and brought us menus and took our drink order.	
Sorry for short review, but c'mon, with this many reviews I'm not adding anything new.	
Also, go after 11pm to get Shoyu Ramen.	
Waitress was sweet and funny.	1
- Go easy on the breadcart.	
I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!	1
Was in our faces for no reason and we just left.	
Vegetarian fast food options are limited.	
First, our waitress was not friendly in the least - she was clearly having a bad afternoon.	
We got the rebel special and the banana with nutella (I can't remember the name).	
As of the writing of this article, her niece had just joined the staff as server and helper.	
I'd rather eat airline food, seriously.	0
The 3rd time I went in after I realized I was going to get sick, I just asked for a refund.	
Cant say enough good things about this place.	1
The ambiance was incredible.	1
The staff was pretty stingy with the vegetables too.	
Super disappointed with a recent experience to Bouchon Bakery.	
They have a bunch of gigantically garish pillars of flame.	
For the price I don't even think I would be back.	
Nothing amazing here.	
Service is hit or miss depending on how busy they are but are very friendly.	
So all you aspiring Mesa Grill patrons, ask yourself this: are you ready for a Let Down?	
The waitress and manager are so friendly.	1
Of course he was, they were zucchini.	
Only food here though.	
The food at Mint falls into the higher-end category - better meats, obviously more hand-made sauces, etc.	
And of course overpriced for the quality and quantity of good though reasonably prices compared to the other Bellagio restaurants.	
I do think it was a tad over cooked but completely bearable.	
I would not recommend this place.	0
My sauce tasted like it was chef boyardee canned sauce.	
#ERROR!	
If you go to robertosaz.com it only has the Anthem location listed and that actually explains everything to me.	
The restaurant is usual busy because they give out so many food comps.	
Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.	0
I don't know if I should give them a second chance or go somewhere where else where they want my money.	
My gyro was basically lettuce only.	0
The waitress said that they didn't have any.	
ordered a spicy shrimp dish.	
Terrible service!	0
I stopped in to get a quickie lunch and it was.	
We also ordered the jumbo sea scallops with edamame succotash.	
Thoroughly disappointed!	0
The servers were cool, laid back and conversational.	
There is a children's menu and non-seafood choices on the regular menu.	
I said "I dont want hot tomatoes and melted cheese" He said "Oh" and rolled his eyes.	
I don't each much pasta, but I love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here.	1
We started the meal with a traditional chips and salsa, augmented with a cup of fresh guacamole.	
The place was relatively packed for an east valley restaurant at almost 11pm.	
I got a flatbread pizza that makes TV dinners seem amazing.	
Give it a try, you will be happy you did.	1
By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!	1
Boy, was I wrong!	
Highly recommend for the gfree people out there!	
Reasonably priced also!	1
Given the other reviews it might be worth giving them a second chance.	
Everything was perfect the night we were in.	1
There are Cheesesteaks, and then there are CHEESESTEAKS!	
That said, I have tried French food in the states.	
I could see the chef cook from where I was sitting.	
The food is very good for your typical bar food.	1
The Eggs Benedict looks like it's mocking you.	
Okay so I have been on a crazy ramen kick these last few weeks.	
Why spend that much for lunch and still have to find something more to eat on the way back to the office?	
I really enjoy eating at this place.. the food is always good and the wait staff feels more like family.	
I went in Saturday afternoon and it was packed.	
Nearly the entire time.	
I was super hungry and decided to order the Diner Burger.	
She said something then I ordered too based off what I saw on the machines, I just wanted something fruity.	
Sure beats the Pho spot I was contemplating inside T.I.	
Wow after having a LONG night of boozing and partying with the girls we stopped in for lunch before we got back to reality.	
Portion size is on the smaller side.	
A truly caring owner.	
it was a drive to get there.	0
I did some research and booked a reservation.	
They also let go the best servers which really made the place so welcoming and "Homey"	
I was with a good friend who I wanted to catch up with so we didn't care and it didn't seems like it made anyone get out of line and leave either.	
At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff.	1
The entree was the FIlet Mignon & North Atlantic Lobster Tail.	
To give them the benefit of the doubt, it WAS Christmas Eve.	
Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.	0
Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed.	1
They definately added to the experience.	
-have you not noticed!!)	
And again the franchise opened another location in Las Vegas.	
So sour it made my face pucker.	
A group of us went here for dinner here last week.	
Oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant.	1
If you haven't gone here GO NOW!	1
It was faster than McDonalds.	
Roaring Fork is running their happy hour from 4 - 10 p.m.	
A greasy, unhealthy meal.	0
Since it was happy hour, we toyed with the idea of sitting in the bar.	
If the sight of seeing children running around having fun will send you into a tizzy, this is not the place for you.	
I tried one of the cherry tomatoes from his dish and though it was a little spicier than mine it wasn't overwhelming.	
More of cheese and egg whites.	
My advice, go to Stripsteak at Mandalay Bay for a truly wonderful steak.	
My wife ordered the 7oz filet.	
The onion rings and frozen hot chocolate was probably the only two things that really stood out to us.	
i didn't know that!	
first time there and might just be the last.	0
the dressing tasted like it came with a kids meal at MacDonald s. What a let down.	
Later, I realized I had been charged for spinach, and I asked why.	
All I remember was lots of patchouli and eating banana chips.	
When they head we were planning a trip to Thailand, the owners sat down & gave us great advice!	
So put on your big girl pants, head on over to The Fry Bread House and pull up a chair.	
I was tempted to count them but the smell of my meal to be was overwhelming so I ate instead.	
You will get better service at home and the decor has to be more attractive.	
We planned on getting sloppy drunk that night so figured we could just crawl to our room and avoid driving for the night.	
Those burgers were amazing.	1
Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.	0
It usually takes well over an hour for all of this.	
Our last dinner there was for New Year's eve 2009.	
The dish was dry and served on a hot plate on a bed of chopped onions.	
I should've known better since I live in las vegas.	
And it was way to expensive.	0
I was absolutely in love after the first bite and it just got better and better as I ate.	
Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.	1
It was, to be honest, slightly fishy like another reviewer had said.	
They were perfectly crisp and soft at the same time.	
then she asked me if i spoke spanish, which i don't cause i'm Filipino not Latin, I told her no, then gave her my order.	
This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.	1
The bartender was also nice.	1
The batter didn't really add anything and I would have preferred them without.	
His response was what about MacAyo's?	
Usually places deep fry the wings.	
Maybe if you combined the mushrooms from both of them you could've actually had enough for one.	
I've had much better sushi on Ventura Blvd.	
Everything was good and tasty!	1
This place is two thumbs up....way up.	1
I tasted almost all of the other items and it was nothing amazing.	
Ones that wont leave my mouth bleeding.	
It's a little more expensive than other sushi places in the area, but still affordable.	
You can get a baked potato instead but it costs $6 for that...lame.	
The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun.	1
If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place.	1
The coffee was also just as delicious, a great mild blend.	
We went in and the staff was really friendly m it was very clean and they have a bar on the other side of the dining room.	
It is a little pricey for lunch though.	
My last review still stands!!!!	
I ordered Pho Ga (#17) and had it within a few minutes.	
Tons of speed bumps and messed up lanes and directional changes.	
Though the staff was friendly, and fast.	
The presentation was all stick on a slice of pineapple.	
Terrible management.	0
Therefore, not all your dishes may come out at the same time.	
Lots to be desired!	
We dine often at the St.	
My husband liked the spicy pork thing he ordered and the garlic chicken was really good, but not really garlicky.	
Compared to other eating options at TI, this place was at least in the ballpark in terms of price.	
An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.	1
So she asks if they have the mango smoothie and the waters we ordered at the start and I slide a diet coke order in there at this time.	
The menu is pricey but I think when I can afford it I will definitely be back.	
The creativity behind each thoughtfully envisioned course and the absolute perfect execution is more than you can hope for in a dining experience.	
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.	0
Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.	1
The grey trash cans, the brown plastic trays....the green awning.... LSB is a CG staple.	
For us, fine dining is just as much about the experience and setting as it is about the food.	
They are spicy but well worth it.	
BTW who wants or needs that much meat?	
Ok.. I'll give it a try.	
Worst martini ever!	0
The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.	1
I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!	1
I really wanted to like the food more than I did.	
It is too hard, dry bread and the custard tastes like snack pack pudding.	
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).	0
The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.	1
I won't try going back there even if it's empty.	0
Just a tad bit more like cubic zirconium in the rough.	
I actually had to put it in the microwave less than 10 minutes after picking it up.	
Miso is my favorite part of the whole sushi experience, and they did just about everything wrong with it.	
No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.	0
They have drink specials from 3-6 and you can get a Bud Light bottle for $3, which is pretty good for Vegas.	
Very sexy, I loved it!	
Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.	1
Unfortunately thats not the case for me.	
Never had a bad experience in a restaurant in a casino.	
Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!	1
I've been here 3 times already and used these coupons!	
This was my third visit.	
not even a "hello, we will be right with you."	0
I always enjoy the open-kitchen atmosphere and we were sitting sufficiently close enough to see them prepare our meals.	
The food wasn't bad, but the value wasn't there.	
The desserts were a bit strange.	0
But my enthusiasm ended there... the chicken was dry and on the bland side.	
They also have TVs so if you're a Football fanatic, you can watch your game, while eating brunch, while listening to live music!	
For dessert they tried the mini pizookie with chocolate chunk ice cream.	
My boyfriend and I love oysters!	
I have noticed many food items out to other patrons that look delicious.	
Uh, where were you like 20 minutes ago?	
My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.	1
I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!	1
Amazing what that little bit of alcohol does to your innerchild.	
And a selection of mouth-watering cakey treats.	
Nice ambiance.	1
I would recommend saving room for this!	1
We arrived at 7 p.m.	
But my favorite part is the grilled onions they bring out with the cips, salsa and bean dip.	
Half of the table, at the recommendation of Man Vs.	
But still quite noisy.	
Especially for the price of a couple bucks per taco.	
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.	0
They basically took all the work out of eating a NY strip.	
When I told him we would not return, he said FINE.	
However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.	0
I'm always torn about what pie to order when I come - Jack Daniels pecan?	
Hit or miss?	
This restaurant is inside the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino.	
I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!	0
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!	0
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.	0
I'm kind of bringing someone their drinks.	
( tasteless).	
i am a vegan who do not like fake meat.	
We will give it another try since we live so close by.	
We never had to ask for water.	
The dish also comes with just the right amount of potatoes.	
I've had 100% better French Onion Soup at a non-French regular old diner joint than here.	
Finally, our salads arrived.	
The place has a nice set up but the food was amiss.	
We took it to go.	
It was the size of half a rice bowl and we both looked at it like WTF.	
All of the tapas dishes were delicious!	1
Okay, enough of my rant on nutrition and on to the food.	
I had a combo of pad Thai with spring rolls.	
we got a salad that seemed to have been sitting around for a week and the pizza was terrible.	
I *heart* this place.	1
Normally when I go with another person, our bill is always under $40.	
- I forgot what it was.	
So I was convinced this was going to be good, after reading all of the rave reviews and seeing a 4 start avg for this place.	
My brother got the chicken strips - also salty, but at least they gave him 4 big strips.	
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.	0
Also my apologies that we graced this establishment with our presence.	
After two I felt disgusting.	0
A good time!	1
Our waiter David instantly took over and started making recommendations.	
It is vegetarian and vegan but I wouldn't exactly call this health food....still a healthier option than most.	
I'll still go there because the food, drinks and service are great, but I'm wondering who else got sick?	
Actually no I wanted some clean dang tacos.	
The structure of the tower with beams and rivets adds to the decor, and feeling of being transported.	
It had a cool vibe to it, and cool wall hangings and lighting, so my first impression was pretty good.	
I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.	1
Generous portions and great taste.	1
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!	0
My guest ordered the mixed grill and I ordered the vegetable biryani as main entrees.	
The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an "Are you being helped?"	0
Food was delicious!	1
AN HOUR... seriously?	0
South west wrap, my sister like her wrap, but needs a hint of spice, she said.	
Do not pass go, do not collect $200.....go DIRECTLY to Maggiano's!	
I consider this theft.	0
My friend ordered a salad as well.	
Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.	0
Sandwich was roast beef, a top bun and a bottom bun.	
I am not being flippant.	
When my burger comes out, it looks like a puck that I just slapshotted in my hockey game!	
The food was just as bad, but time the service was I inattentive as well.	
The cheese tasted great and the crispy/soft shell around it was very nice.	
Can't wait for one to open in Summerlin!	
Overall I have to say I enjoyed the food at the NOLA location but liked the sophisticated atmosphere and vibe of this Venetian restaurant better.	
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.	0
Waited and waited and waited.	0
Our antipasto, pizza, and molten lava cake came to about $40 without tax or tip.	
Almost like oven-roasted potatoes you'd get with a pork roast.	
Maybe the experience would have been different if I dined in, but I won't waste my money to experiment.	
He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service.	1
It used to be the place I wanted to go.	
Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.	1
When I get a sweet tooth and decide I want something ice cream-like, this is near the top of my list.	
Its an all you can eat sushi place for newcomers of sushi and aren't too picky.	
Best Tiramisu ever, both the frozen and the cake versions.	
My friend asked "Is it good?"	
The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.	0
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.	0
FIX has warm donuts with dipping sauce on their dessert menu!	
When I pull up to the window to get my food, the person handing me my food just stares at me.	
There were only 4 other tables in there on a Monday night.	
There are too many great Mexican restaurants in town (Javier's I'm thinking of you) to ever go back.	
Service was good and the company was better!	1
30 beers on tap.	
Don't get me wrong, still a fantastic overall burger but lacking the essential flavor I wanted.	
The staff are also very friendly and efficient.	1
We asked a question, she asked the man at the bar.	
For those of you that are not a fan of the tomato persuasion, you know how comforting it is lately to see bruschetta that does not contain tomatoes.	
There are some folks who sing great and some who don't sound anywhere close to good so you don't have to worry about not measuring up.	
As for the service: I'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks.	1
Has it been ready that entire time but fixing the register trumped your customers?!	
There were tables with guests all around us, and servers were actively waiting them, but no one ever came to our table.	
Regardless of where I was in Vegas, there was always that questionable orange Hooters tempo smacking me upside the cornea.	
I noticed that they have a great happy hour to offset the dinner prices.	
Boy was that sucker dry!!.	0
Over rated.	0
If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.	0
The Asian woman working in the dessert station deserves her own paragraph.	
We ordered 3 different noodle dishes, my husband and I were able to substitute tofu on ours and my brother-in-law ordered chicken.	
Their steaks are 100% recommended!	1
Slurped it right up.	
The wine markup was about 2.5x retail across the board, which was not surprising for Scottsdale.	
After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.	0
Ironically, our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself.	
Finally, let me comment on the service.	
Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.	1
I've never had stale chips!	
All in all, I can assure you I'll be back.	1
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.	0
Tiramisu, Raspberry Cheesecake, Brownie Sundae, Blackberry Rhubarb Compote, and Apple Caramel Ala Mode.	
My breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar.	1
We were furious plus it doesn't help I was so hungry prior to getting there and one of my friends husband was on his lunch break.	
She told me about Mimi's and how good their breakfast menu was.	
The kids play area is NASTY!	0
Great place fo take out or eat in.	1
I'm cool with that, I kinda liked it b/c I would rather just grab what I want rather than have to keep asking.	
it was just ok.	
The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.	1
I flag down the hostess, who says she will find out what is going on.	
Husband got a bottle of sake and I went with an Albarino.	
We saw the chinese food and it looked alright and took a chance anyway.	
OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.	1
We're headed to Napa in a month and clearly we know at least one stop we'll be making.	
Add to this that my friend's nachos were wet and missing the cheese (really?)	
For breakfast - I've had the Devil's Mess - eggs, fresh veggies, chorizo and chiles and the Fresh fruit with Oatmeal and Yogurt.	
It was extremely "crumby" and pretty tasteless.	0
And, after doing so, while I do not consider it to currently be the best steakhouse in Las Vegas, I was impressed.	
They also have a dining area separate from the bar.	
Fries were run of the mill boring fries, and the jalapenos not spicy at all.	
Too hot to wait outside.	
I started off with a vodka and Red Bull.	
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	0
Given the cost and the fact I'm not going to eat a whole cow at a single sitting, I don't see this as much of a value for the $ spent.	
The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.	1
For the life of me I kept thinking he said it was some sort of tongue but then after trying it I figured out it was cod.	
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!	0
It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!	1
I really enjoyed Crema Caf√© before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.	1
His were slightly better than mine but not by much.	
The only redeeming point is the seafood.	
I couldn't finish because the cheese they used made me nauseous after a few bites.	
Not good for the money.	0
I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!	1
We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.	0
Make no mistake, the quality and freshness are still evident here; I just don't get the Express thing.	
I ordered a steak and my wife got a margarita and the nachos.	
I was there for 15 mins and i had to walk to the bar to place my order.	
The staff was nice, but not entirely attentive.	
They also have the best cheese crisp in town.	1
Good value, great food, great service.	1
Couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.	1
The food is good.	1
That being said, I probably need to try some new places after my experience tonight.	
The steak wasn't the best I ever tasted but it was probably in the top ten.	
There are too many other good and competent sushi joints in the valley to waste time here.	
It was awesome.	1
I am in love with the key lime pie!	
Service was casual and friendly.. We were seated as soon we arrived.	
I just wanted to leave.	0
Sodas come in bottles so if you drink more and one it of course cost you more.	
We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!	1
I will not be eating there again.	0
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!	0
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.	0
She then turned us over to another waiter who scrambled to get proper settings.The calamari was over cooked ( dark brown and crunchy ).	
With this platter, they also served freshly grated wasabi and freshly ground salt.	
The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.	0
Luckily for me, I had a $75 food comp for myself and some family so all we had to shell out was a few bucks.	
However, this place would not qualify as good in my book.	
Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(	0
An absolute must visit!	1
Bread was hot.	
And don't forget to add the fish sauce and any of the multitude of other sweet, savory, and spicy sauces and pastes, Sriracha included.	
11:55 - Finally got seated.	
It is a nice bar/ restaurant to watch sports in.	
and surely not worth the $40.00 plus a tip bill.	
They also put an obscene amount of basil leaf on the pizza, which fortunately was not as soggy because most of it burnt up into a flaky black powder.	
All their steaks come with garlic chips (no garlic flavor here either--garlic fail #3) and a mushroom Rockefeller, a breadcrumb stuffed mushroom cap.	
You've been warned!	
The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.	1
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.	0
I know that other people have raved about their $2 beer happy hours.	
Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.	0
I take off the foil to the last taco.	
They really want to make your experience a good one.	1
We ordered hummus and expected it to be served with pita bread, naturally.	
I will not return.	0
I had always seen this place since I've lived in Glendale for so long but I never ventured inside.	
They're really nice (but then again, what In-N-Out staff ISN'T nice?!)!	
I am from NC so soul food is in my blood (and on my hips!).	
Obnoxious--as in "over the top."	
Overall, a great experience, and while I've yet to return, I will be back one of these days.	
The country store has a lot of tea, cheeses, breads and veggies.	
The restaurant really has a nice atmosphere with the German music playing in the background and nice decorations from Germany.	
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.	0
Twenty minutes in they called #8 and it was pretty obvious they lacked institutional restaurant control.	
Very disappointing!!!	0
The first time I got the hamburger.	
The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.	1
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.	0
More than two people have to share a bottle.	
do they make particularly weak wasabi at Hiro's?	
Surprisingly, the made to order pizzas are really good too.	
I was very surprised because this place received many awards.	
The host and a gentleman were standing at the podium talking away.	
The poorly constructed wine list was extremely over priced.	
They have a Beer Club!	
Update: 24 March 2008 Robert McGrath sold his interest in the Roaring Fork.	
latte with honey.	
Pretty awesome place.	1
It was served in a beer flute like glass.	
Ambience is perfect.	1
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.	0
Our waiter generously offered to move us to a table on the other side of the patio, which worked out perfectly.	
Both meals were very hot and had lots of good flavors,the french fries were not store bought and cooked just right non-greasy.	
I first ordered a skinny marg and liked that just fine.	
You can spend a good amount of time playing pool or watching sports on one of the 10+ flat screens.	
He got a bbq burger instead, he ordered fries but was given the cold soggy wedges also.	
I'd never heard of it, and was excited to try it.	
I had a combination plate with orange Chicken, Egg Drop soup & a fountain drink Mr.	
Well you all lived up to the rumor....the hostess was very rude and unprofessional.	
She offered up anything on the menu to replace it instead of my money.	
The fries are the only reason Five Guys got 2 stars.	
This place is a must see for any out of town friends or family, but put it on your "favorites"list.	
It was kind of sad.	
It texts you when your table is ready.	
We also ordered three pizzas (for two adults and two kids - oh my) the margherita, wise guy and sonny boy.	
I have been to this place dozens of times, even way before I started Yelping and checking in to places.	
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.	0
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.	0
It was also cool when it came out, which was weird.	
She didn't like it at all, saying it was flavorless and was left yearning for a cannoli from Whole Foods (Ray/101).	
I ended up deciding on the grilled cheese to eat.	
And even though they only take cash, that doesn't bother me one bit seeing as how they manage to keep their prices really low.	
The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!	1
While I personally would have liked to have had more cheese, they burger was good, overall.	
I don't know for sure since there was a lot of sauce.	
This waiter was very outgoing and personable, unlike his partner who seemed a bit snooty.	
Hey maybe throw it on your burger and go Pittsburgh style!	
Ordered the deluxe skillet.	
I couldn't though because as everyone else was getting served my taste buds and stomach told me not to.	
So I decided to check out their bathroom.	
The dough was severely under cooked to the point of the crust to be deemed officially MIA.	
Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !	1
The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!	1
Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.	0
Despite the presence of Horseradish... could not provide enough flavor contrast to save the entree.	
My sister recommended this place so we decided to try it.	
So I ask her, even though I didn't get cheese, sour cream or dressing?	
They are served with three sauces..you guessed it!...All incredibly salty too.	
High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.	1
and we picked the stuffed mushrooms, calimari, and cheese sticks.	
Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.	0
and the burger/brats and beer for only $6.	
The rest of Delux's menu is unnecessarily huge and for some reason they also serve sushi.	
THREE DOLLARS ON A FORTY DOLLAR ORDER!	
2 great burgers hold the mediocre fries.	
The food was good considering the fact that they were about to close so a lot of it was put away.	
Love the outside, great for Phoenix winters.	
We were promptly greeted and seated.	1
It was a little scary to walk with a plate of food because everyone was bumping into each other.	
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.	0
To mtop it off the drinks were over priced and the performance was crappy.	
I think it's a obvious mistake, though.	
Would give an extra star for fixing any one of those issues, two if all were fixed.	
And the pho is much better when it is served fresh.	
I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.	1
After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.	0
Duly noticed!	
This is a good joint.	1
The Macarons here are insanely good.	1
I'm not eating here!	0
The guy at the counter was patient in explaining how to order and such, but otherwise they weren't the friendliest at the counter.	
Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative.	1
I wanted gluten free pizza, and we were staying in PH, so we decided to grab some pizza from Lombardi's and then walk around.	
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.	0
The setting of the place is very elegant and relaxing outside but still not a reason why a small piece of fish should be so expensive	
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.	0
To get in the restaurant, they let you wear a hospital gown to stick with the hospital theme.	
Stop turning your nose up just cuz its at a cheesy, old hotel.	
You would think after a review like this that we would never return.	
Very bad Experience!	0
(3 out of 5 on that service) Now for the most important part: 5 STARS on the FOOOOOD!!!!!	
What a mistake.	0
Oh wait, no it's not.	
Food was average at best.	0
The luxurious, filling pho that I always enjoy at Da Vang was replaced by a bowl of broth and noodles.	
Ate here on a Friday night about a week ago.	
My friend and I decided to order a few of their small plates as a full on meal wasn't something we were looking for at 9 PM.	
Gentle Strength moved to a new location recently and this has given them lots of room to stretch their wings.	
I mean literally flaming.	
Would have been five stars but the price to portion ratio was a little high.	
Great food.	1
A must get is the prime rib and crab legs, and for dessert cookies and gelato.	
Looks like the 4 items were sitting there for a long time.	
I live nearby this new location, I have never been to a Texas Roadhouse before so I figured we'd try it some time.	
We won't be going back anytime soon!	0
They are tangy and a bit spicy...delicious!	
Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.	0
My friend had the filet and I had the prime rib and both were fabulous.	
A little pricey without the 50% discount, though.	
Very strange place.	
Would go back for drinks or with a date who was footing the bill.	
Also found this place on Yelp, and Yelpers were very helpful again.	
Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.	1
Peanut butter & jelly gelato!	
It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.	1
Had some nefarious person stolen my dipping juice?	
I had their signature combo with 3 different types of tacos and all the items were dry.	
I liked that they were generous with the pineapple on it though, but it tasted just like cold, canned pineapple tidbits.	
I looked around and I thought that the d√©cor was alright, it was a little tacky but I like to have my bars a little on the tacky side.	
We then had an ice cream sandwich, with pistachio ice cream, the ice cream did not taste like pistachio.	
Now I have to eat salad that's not pleasant?	
Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.	0
The patio seating was very comfortable.	1
We had received a gift card and were excited to use it.	
I love my steak rare but this thing came out beyond mooing... it was also very under seasoned.	
The fried rice was dry as well.	0
Decoration is much nicer than other places.	
They have deals for lunch.	
I docked a half a star since Roka is, IMHO, a tad overpriced but it is Scottsdale...	
On to Lalibela perhaps for our next Ethiopian outing!	
It was delicious though.	
I noted that because of Scottsdale rents and having a nice decor and tablecloths, etc the prices are higher.	
And there is no other steakhouse that will serve it with the perfection it deserves.	
The Yellowtail and tomato salad were just okay.	
I myself, took a nice quantity of shrimp, and except for peeling the shell, basically had a nice shrimp cocktail (on a plate).	
Their volcano nachos are ridiculously huge but good to share with a huge group.	
Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!	1
The owner is great to visit and discuss poke, deep sea fishing, and the finer aspects of what make his poke so good.	
It was too bland, but tapitio and ketchup made it better.	
I don't care one way or the other about the manufactured "healthy hype"...it is pizza and when I eat pizza, I just want it to taste good.	
....The recipe for the crust, seems to of changed.	
That just SCREAMS "LEGIT" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas.	1
It was just not a fun experience.	1
The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.	1
I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!).	1
Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!	1
Having heard rave reviews about this place from several friends over the years, we finally decided to try it for lunch.	
The music was really loud and distracting considering the fact that it was today's hits that everyone knows and can sing along with.	
The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.	1
Ichiza (upstairs) is always slammed!	
Overall, it was a free meal, and we left full, but it was uncomfortable, and only moderately tasty.	
Please come to NJ!!!	
You are overpaying for it's name and the fact it's Vegas' oldest steakhouse.	
Both great!	1
NOW GO TO TURKEY THEN YOU CAN COMPARE UNTIL THEN PIPE IT DOWN.	
Eclectic selection.	1
I don't know - it just seems like looking at Ra these days is like looking at an aging rock star trying to hang on to better days.	
I still tipped accordingly because I too live off tips but I would have tipped double at least if the circumstances were different.	
She told husband to bring it home.	
Don't taste the onions.	
The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.	1
I've never heard of or seen this on a menu before, but when my girlfriend saw them she went nuts.	
Until next time, Let's Eat!	
Better yet is that this dump still hasn't figured out that they are in a service industry and that their customers need to be serviced.	
It was dirty, with graffiti scratched on various surfaces and is in bad need of paint, new caulking and a good cleaning.	
The staff was very attentive.	1
And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).	1
The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price.	1
They will be missed.	
Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.	0
dont go here.	0
Very efficient.	
It took me a while to write this review because I really didn't know what to say.	
She then brought my husband the tiniest, most watered down rum and coke imaginable.	
This furniture is wicked.	
The sauce had great flavor and the cheese was fantastic.	
I promise they won't disappoint.	1
As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.	0
I didn't taste it, but I saw the plate.	
I've eaten here occasionally for years and always thought the food was good, especially the crispy honey chicken.	
Whether servers are new or not, if they are not ready to be on the floor, there should be more training before they're working on their own.	
If I owned this place after working so hard to make it what it is with that beautiful smoker and exterior scenery.	
What a great double cheeseburger!	1
Awesome service and food.	1
A fantastic neighborhood gem !!!	1
The happy hour on Friday is great, lasting till 9:00 pm which is unheard of.	
Went here last Sun on the way back from hiking at Sedona.	
I had dinner here 2night on the way home from walking my dogs and, never having eaten here before, wasn't expecting anything much.	
So the food was decent.	
We were served a basket of artisan bread and each ordered the prime rib, medium rare, along with asparagus and a baked potato.	
I can't wait to go back.	1
Just need that little excuse to get out to Tempe... Getting there for EARLY happy hour and get a seat in the bar area the next time.	
Would you like to have zero noodles in your chow mein but actually receive a small white bag of things that look similar to capt.	
The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.	0
They grated some lemon on it probably to mask the unfreshness of the fish.	
It's a great place and I highly recommend it.	1
On a more recent trip through the drive through I again had a similar experience in which the cashier at the window did not give me all my change.	
My husbands mushroom ravioli in pink sauce was alright, but again the raviolis were clearly not housemade.	
I really resent being kicked out of the table and being pushed.	
Service was slow and not attentive.	0
Classy lacks basic reading comprehension because most of his message doesn't even fit with my review.	
I gave it 5 stars then, and I'm giving it 5 stars now.	1
Some people will probably be irked by this, but I enjoyed it for the places it lets my mind wander.	
I also tasted the lamb meatballs and they were fabulous, although the hot pink sour cream they were served with was a bit oddly colored.	
Most diners are oblivious, we are acutely aware of the skills required.	
I think I would give this place one more chance and update my review.	
The sushi prices were neither exorbitant nor cheap.	
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.	0
If you're going for the first time, get the number 5.	
Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.	1
I came here yesterday with a groupon that just started.	
Very good food, great atmosphere.1	1
I ate here for the first time today.	
Damn good steak.	1
THE lounge is kinda smal and dark .	
Pretty much my BFF.	
10 minutes passed....still no service.	
VERY clean place and the person behind the counter was very nice and helpful.	
You might end up "like megan".	
No such feelings here.	
I've been here a few times.	
Total brunch fail.	0
Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo.	1
Restaurant week strikes again!!!	
Definitely a must return for this gal...	
Other food was just okay.	
The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.	1
The sandwiches are palatable, yet unremarkable, but what's most-prominent is that they are a half-sized sandwich.	
The food is good and hot but the wait time is horrible.	
The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!	1
Notice he doesn't say anything about my remarks regarding disgusting mozzarella and too much oil.	
Wow they loaded them with cheese!!	
We strolled in here one day for lunch and ordered a bunch of stuff off their menu.	
And you get a lot for the price.	
I look forward to the other side opening to see the menu and prices.	
While the wait staff is still friendly and works at the same speed they always have, the wait time for food itself has increased ten fold.	
Sashimi salad consisting of salmon, ahi tuna and albacore 3.	
The grilled vegetables were good, although I don't know that I would have ordered it if I knew there were parsnips and brussel sprouts.	
It's really too bad I have to downgrade to 4 stars, but maybe next time I come by I'll have a more attentive waiter.	
I ended this incredible adventure with my favorite, Creme Br√ªl√©e, and again....perfection.	
Great Guac.	
Just a great evening for not knowing about the food there.	
Then she made a mistake in our order.	
I was here for a business meeting and the nachos were just horrible!	
There are a few all you can eat places in LA that are both good and well priced i.e.	
the one thing i distictly remember is having to drunkenly sleep up on the A/C because it works so poorly.	
Good food , good service .	1
I absolutely love the granola and would take granola and bananas as a topping on these acai bowls any day.	
Taggia suddenly looked a lot more enticing.	
It was absolutely amazing.	1
Hence the aforementioned "beats."	
Very talkative.... despite not knowing very much about the restaurant management.	
I probably won't be back, to be honest.	0
About 5 minutes went by and he stopped by once again and said the steaks would be right there.	
will definitely be back!	1
The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.	1
The batter here is also far too chewy.	
We looked at each other in silence and thought how really weird this was.	
Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I've tried so far and they're all good.	1
After we ordered I decided to check the place out.	
I know they had a couple different options but I am not TOO adventurous... It was a goat cheese ravioli with a very very rich mushroom cream sauce.	
It's sweet but not exactly like ice cream.. More like frozen yogurt.	
Note: The rating and review does not include any bias on the presence of the ladies, just the food and the restaurant.	
-- Again, outside of the "sushi" realm, portion size could very well disappoint.	
Went for lunch - service was slow.	0
We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.	0
I was mortified.	0
You have your choice of 6 soups and a salad that is custom made by the servers as you walk the line.	
I think it is a big practical joke and the punchline is 5 years away.	
In the end, bad experience ruins the night and dinner.	
Emboldened, we walked away with two arepas.	
Got the beef bowl that people were raving about on here.	
Well we stood at the hostess stand for about 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us!	
I have to say though, Lolo's totally came through.	
And you wouldn't like me when I'm hungry and angry.	
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.	0
Mussels were different than we usually see and very good.	
The booths were romantic and private, compared to the other tables.	
Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.	0
The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.	0
Next time will try the salt-n-pepper	
They do have a pretty legit gelato bar if that's your scene.	
2 - The phrase "Chicago-Style Pizza" should be regulated like organic and kosher.	
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.	0
Have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!	1
We were seated with a friendly, welcoming greeting at the front of the restaurant in a nice and bright window bench.	
The only problem in the entire meal is the vegetables were barely warm with everything else hot.	
The prices are a bit expensive for only receiving decent sushi.	
A close second is the pork belly and the albacore.	
Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.	1
3-7pm everyday, life is good in Scottsdale.	
so yay for soy paper!	
The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.	1
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.	0
The atmosphere here is fun.	1
Our 30 minute dinner wasn't cheap, either.	
The waitress must have noticed the glazed over look and smile on my face because she rhetorically asked, "so, how is it?"	
When I pulled up to this place, I broke my first rule of dining: Never eat at a place with more wait staff than tables with customers.	
We forgot to do so and they didn't have one available for us after dinner.	
So finally after settling into our second room we got a rewards card for gambling.	
Would not recommend to others.	0
Being it December, I decided on coming back to have another Beef Wellington since it seemed like the perfect meal for the holidays.	
i'm actually going to get some togo tonight.	
I wasn't paying attention and wow!	
From reading the other reviews, it seems like this is a popular brunch spot.	
Service is quick and even "to go" orders are just like we like it!	1
We got quick service for our drink order - but got serverd in styrafome cups...really??	
I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!	0
To echo some other reviews: insane portions to soak up alchohol?	
We were there at 5 PM and maybe 15-18 others were there.	
That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.	1
I was hungry so I ate several but woke up in the middle of the night and got sick.	
Not my thing.	0
2 Thumbs Up!!	1
He started to fuss on and off during dinner.	
Especially when I added a little bit of their Pico.	
Pretty much all of the places mentioned have nicer atmosphere.	
I suppose I could have asked to order something that was not on the menu.	
For $17, Blue Hound, feel free to include a speck of meat.	
If you are reading this please don't go there.	0
I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza.	1
Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!	1
Plus, they feature some local brews.	
The prices are a little high if you have alcohol with dinner, but we had a coupon for free desserts with each entree.	
My college town had a great alcoholic smoothie/slushie pace and it was bomb, everyone loved it and could not get enough of it.	
They have a really nice atmosphere.	1
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.	0
If you want a good Mexican meal with a Southwestern twist, try the Blue Agave.	
Was excited to try the wings after reading reviews.	
My suggestion is if you want Kathy's food, call for take out.	
After one bite, I was hooked.	1
I remembered this place on my "to eat" list from YELP.	
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.	0
Cute, quaint, simple, honest.	1
There were tables outside, as we left someone was smoking there.	
You need to make a reservation at least a day or two in advance!	
I guess they were in a hurry even though the place was 2/3 empty.	
Line system is a little ridiculous - different lines for different meats - which makes it a pain to try different meats.	
I was expecting more exotic French foods.	
The pulled chicken and pulled pork were a bit bland, but not too fatty.	
The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.	1
We started out with an order of onion strings, which our party of 4 quickly finished.	
There were so many people and they said the wait was well over an hour.	
The food was great as always, compliments to the chef.	1
We were about 10 minutes late, but luckily and surprising the restaurant was behind schedule.	
Gave us the wrong change which took a while to correct (not in our favor by the way).	
we saw a coyote standing near the tee about 20 yards away and also a rabbit down on the fairway.	
The manager that took 50% off the bill (after also charging me for food that we never received or ate) was very unatentive otherwise.	
So I tried it, but for me, it was all hype.	
go in there and get something.	
Delivery: 1/5.	
Food was great, service was great and happy hour prices were decent.	
Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.	1
Prices were what you would expect for good sushi, but definitely over-priced for the quality that was served here.	
Awesome selection of beer.	1
Now until our food came crab cake appetizers and ribeye with mashed garlic potatoes and veggies.	
That's fine, too.	
Great food and awesome service!	1
One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.	1
The gravy had no signs of onion in it.	
Vegas Baby!!	
It tasted old like it had been made days before.	
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!	0
Wish the owners had been there and if they are when you visit give them a shout.	
Sitting next to the open air kitchen, we watched at least 6 party's seated after us receive their food before us.	
I forget the menu description now, but there were crispy shallots or something tossed with the pasta.	
Later in the evening, after the DJ played Daft Punk's "One More Time," I went up to him to follow up.	
The back room has tall bushes carved into the silhouettes of busty ladies.	
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.	1
As for the service, I thought it was good.	1
Order this or else.	
She also filled the coffee fast and cleared plates quickly so we could get more plates on the table.	
The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.	0
I'm willing to give it a second shot, but I've had better Chinese food.	
We declined and he did not ask us to pay for the meals.	
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.	0
Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.	1
Overall, I like there food and the service.	1
Sorry Steve Wynn, you've failed on this one.	
I HATE having to leave this review because the Portillos in Scottsdale blew me away when I first heard of this chain.	
For the prices what they charged, we felt how in the world this place charges so much when their quality of their food CONSISTENCY is just not there?	
They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.	1
Bayonne-Style Corned Beef Hash Benedict for $9.99.	
Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.	0
The television was on a novela with no sound, I'm sure it was earlier on a World Cup game but still weird.	
they put way too much oil which was a bummer cuz there was no rice to soak up.	
I've worked at a 5 star/5 diamond restaurant but have my favorite hole in the wall no star joints with excellent service and quality food.	
Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.	0
Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.	1
They were basically corn tortillas with some shredded cheddar cheese melted on top.	
I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.	1
Never had anything to complain about here.	1
The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.	1
They have some new menu items that we tried out this weekend and very delicious.	
The hosts were from Glenlivet, Glenmorangie and Macallan.	
Luckily, maybe because it was late there wasn't a wait at all.	
My husband convinced me to give them another chance and we sat down for some lunch.	
We usually get one or two appetizers or hot offerings.	
I will, however, be returning because Grandma thinks this place is amazing, and I really think it's because of the owner.	
I had the burger, which was good but nothing amazing.	
Please let us find another boba joint that is legit for our Vegas trips!	
It was way over fried.	0
There may be 3 items cheaper than that and they're all small.	
Not my idea of a romantic night out.	
Then getting all the way home to eat it and it not being the right order is just frustrating.	
I tried the sausage, brisket, prime rib and lamb chop.	
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.	0
The questions you have to ask yourself is, "Do I feel lucky?"	
When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.	0
Pizza can vary depending on who is making it.	
I'm stoked.	
meh pretty much sums it up!	
We come here for the first time a good time.	
Will not be back!	0
However, if you are planning to order alcohol, beware.	
They were awesome in catering to what we wanted.	
There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.	1
Pretty same subs as every other location except they charge $2-3 more for the same thing.	
An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.	1
There were teens and families with small children everywhere.	
I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.	1
The sausage and cheesy garlic bread was pretty good, my brother seems to enjoy it a lot but the olive tapenade was just okay, nothing special.	
I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!	0
How else can one remark about Scottsdale sushi rolls except that they are safe to consume?	
He then had a slice of mine and he said the same thing, kinda boring and no taste.	
I'm torn between 4-5 stars but I'm feeling generous.	
(Which is practically all of them..) I know its their "signature" flavor, so there isn't much else to say here.	
We came here for lunch before driving back to Sacramento.	
The rest of the meal and salad was OK but nothing to write home about.	
I ordered a steak burrito and got chorizo.	
Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.	1
I ordered the Hawaiian pizza and got the thai chicken pizza instead.	
I WILL continue to go to the original S.T.	
3-7pm Otherwise pry wouldn't go!	
So I'm staying at Caesar's Palace and they have a Central there.	
Tonight I sat at the bar and chatted with the beautiful and friendly bar staff.	
I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.	1
My boyfriend and I made a lunch reservation to celebrate his promotion at work.	
Potatoes were slightly undercooked, but the flavored coating masked it.	
The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth.	1
I received what the chef calls the streak dismantled, or dismembered, or something to that effect.	
Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup.	1
Even though the salad didn't look attractive, it was fabulous.	
We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!	1
Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.	0
I'll give her back a few prawns just for a few more noodles.	
When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!	1
I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.	0
They could be really good, but right now they are just frozen french fries with garlic on them.	
This is a GREAT place to eat!	1
My favorite is their mango, and it ain't from concentrate!	
Not the quiet romantic lunch we had hoped for.	
I moved from Arizona in August and I was happy to leave.	
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.	1
As the Germans would say... "Nicht so gut!!"	
The service was poor and thats being nice.	0
i could shingle my roof with them!	
I wish I had ordered the bone marrow ravioli instead, next time!	
Oh, and no one even asked why we ate nothing.	
I'm taking my business elsewhere."	
Food was good, service was good, Prices were good.	1
I will say a couple of good points were the beef, chicken and seafood they used were of good quality.	
Thanks for trying us but you seem to like the americanized version better."	
If what you're looking for is a cheap (in price and quality) Denny's style restaurant in the casino, then this is your place.	
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!	0
I would say the only thing that was good was their selection of milkshakes but I am not really a fan of sweets so can't say much about that.	
This was actually a downside for me, as I don't necessarily want so much dessert, I just wanted to try them all.	
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.	0
And I've had better garlic bread come with a frozen dinner.	
The best I think I've had.	
But the service was beyond bad.	0
I'm so happy to be here!!!"	1
Tasted like dirt.	0
One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .	1
I mentioned it to my husband, & he said the same thing.	
The block was amazing.	1
i've had the chicken and the tuna.	
Ordered two 44 strawberry fruit slush and one corn dog.	
It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.	1
One got extremely excited, pointing and shouting to his companions and the bus in general, "Cowboy Indians!	
She said our server had to cash us out, so we told her we haven't seen her in at least 10 minutes.	
An old whipped donkey perhaps?	
* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!	1
You think?!	
martini to the brim with the Well vodka is $7.	
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.	0
Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.	1
If you don't mind the wait, then this is well recommended.	
Do the math you idiots, I've spent roughly $200 with you, now I bring my wife her for her birthday and you can't give me the meal for free??	
the food is not tasty at all, not to say its "real traditional Hunan style".	0
One stand-out experience that halted my visits for a long time, occurred on St.	
SO FUN!!!!!	
Ended up going to this Tony Roma's which is inside the Fremont Casino with a large group (my family primarily).	
The cooking is done at your table over gas grills.	
What did bother me, was the slow service.	0
The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!	1
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.	0
Mini-flying saucers, and they were invading our dinner table - for what?	
They serve a really good Borscht with an authentic bread cap, and the Shashlyk is to die for.	
Bouchon is Las Vegas' signature French brasserie, but I try to seek out other places.	
I had never been there and i heard that their wings were famous.	
The bad: my sister ordered the sea bass which was served with clams.	
These were so good we ordered them twice.	1
They used to deliver but stopped that as well.	
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.	0
Your order will NOT be taken!"	
Good server but food is not up to par.	
each, plan on paying for the chips...it does state free when you order an appetizer on the menu, but seriously that is just silly!	
AND it did not taste like hardwood smoked bacon!	
After paying a $4 delivery charge, $1 convenience fee.	
a very disappointing buffet in such a nice casino hotel.	
My girlfriend's veal was very bad.	0
Unfortunately, it was not good.	0
Although the food was delicious, we had some issues with customer service.	
Was hankering for a frosty-fry combination.	
I had a pretty satifying experience.	1
Join the club and get awesome offers via email.	1
We will never go to any of these restaurants and I we will spread this to all of our friends so they don't go either.	
Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.	1
Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining.	
THERE WAS A SAFETY PIN STICKING OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THE SHEETS.	
I felt like you can get this stuff anywhere.	
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.	0
The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.	0
The Manager should not be allowed to talk to customers or be on the floor.	
It is GINORMOUS so I would definitely suggest sharing it between at least 4 people.	
There's nothing special about the rolls at sushi station, but the price is a lot cheaper than grocery store sushi, and the quality is much better.	
Didn't have Bohemia beer (hello, is this a high-end Mexican restaurant, amigo?).	
Plates of pasta are much bigger in Italy, and they aren't exactly supersizing everything.	
And on top of this experience, the waiter tried charging us "FLAMINGO WATER" $4 for 2 people.	
Not really a great impression.	
The egg on the croissant had a crusty edge , but yet egg was cooked over medium as requested (pan was too hot).	
Pretty standard mac n' cheese, but with a delicious baked crust on top.	
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!	1
He expected them to be hot and was a little put off by them.	
Try the corn and if you still feel a teensy bit hungry, go for a dessert.	
The sampler came with small square cheesecakes and cream puffs.	
We will not be coming back.	0
I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.	1
There were three urinals lined up with no partition, one urinal was off to the side with a wooden wall.	
I could not thank her enough.	
FINALLY, we were settled and began ordering our drinks and food.	
We started with appetizers.	
I had about $5 worth of food.	
I've had better milkshakes at In N Out Burger or Dick's Drive In.	
It felt very NYC (as I learned later, it has a sister restaurant in NYC).	
Entree...I ordered the 9oz filet medium well.	
The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.	1
That is not a normal wait time for a diner in a business area for lunch.	
We met people form Indiana, Denver , and Brazil jus to name a few that was staying at the hotel .	
#ERROR!	
Cannot beat this espec.	
The cheeses did not present itself in a natural progressive order along the palette leaving conflicting flavors fighting over oral real estate.	
Walked in & waited a good couple of minutes while he chatted with co-worker about the previous night.	
I can think of any number of places I have been to that are just as nice.	
I freaking love me some condiments on any day from anywhere.	
Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.	1
I ordered a large milk tea taro to-go for my BF once and didn't taste it cause it was for him.	
When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.	1
Just because they were plated all in one plate, they all tasted sour-ish and limey too.	
Went earlier this evening with 2 people who have never been.	
Dining area is empty except for one couple.	
Once your food arrives it's meh.	0
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.	0
The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.	1
If there were kinks, it's that we found the decor/chairs/linens too 'hotel standard' and lacking in charm.	
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.	0
For only $5.99 you can choose from a variety of different sandwiches.	
Everything was there except my cologne & deodrant.	
I felt like if I stuck some on my arm, it would be absorbed by my skin and instantly turned into fat and an artery clog.	
I just really do not know how he can make any sort of living given the amount of traffic he was getting.	
This is our new burger/fry/chili place.	
Maine Lobster Pot Pie: Mr.	
Now the food.	
I've been to Serendipity 3 in NYC and this for me was a disappointment.	
It is not fine dining in any respect.	
So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.	1
The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.	1
This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Mediocre food.	0
I noticed a display case filled with dessert-type items.	
I've eaten falafel in every city, but this was the show-stopper.	
The Woked Asparagus had the same flavor as the mushrooms, both of which tasted suspiciously similar to the Chicken with Asparagus.	
So the rest of the food must be the talk of the joint.	
To our favorite Chicago Steak house restaurant readers, your eyeballs will pop out of your heads with dismay.	
I've heard way good stuff about this place for a while and finally had the pleasure of sitting down and having some lunch there.	
$8.99 itself is a very good price for this buffet.	
I will be returning!	
Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.	1
The spare ribs and the crab legs and the short ribs were empty when we came in and remained empty until we were almost ready to leave.	
I'm super pissd.	0
I will be filing a report first thing Tuesday morning since it is a holiday tomorrow.	
When I asked if they served them with chocolate I was expecting the way they serve them in Spain.	
And service was super friendly.	1
it was sunday from 4 to 5pm and the place wasn't packed at all so the fact that nobody came by for a while at first annoyed me.	
We basically waited there so long, we could've nearly finished our meal there.	
I said no, will just eat it.	
The service was ok, the food, some good, some not so great.	
I like breakfast but not here.	
I think she had too many tables.	
I really really want to come back (to spy on the hot waiter) and try their brunch because that seems to be where the real magic happens!	
He loved the flavor that the white raisins brought to the dish.	
When I hand out a 5 star review, it pretty much needs to be at the top of my list in that dining category.	
Also, the turkey was so shredded, it was unrecognizable as such.	
My advise- miss the driveway and swing into Jack in the Box.	
I even had a manager come to the table to suggest some food items and a very good whiskey (Yamazaki.)	
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?	0
The shrimp wonton soup.	
The staff was friendly, and that's about all I really have to say in a positive fashion.	
came here for post nye snack.	
We arrived right at 5PM and got seated at a booth by the bar.	
Spent a good 10 minute walking us through the choices.	
This place is also good choice for hangover too :) I did gained 5lb after i left this place	
Can't wait to go back!	
This place was such a nice surprise!	1
I just saw someone else review about 50 chicken nuggets for 9.99, I would've gotten that and split it with a bunch of drunk people if I knew.	
They were golden-crispy and delicious.	1
It gets better.	
The biscuit was flaky and huge.	
My advice would be to sell the expensive string wrapping machine, and spend a little money on some plain old take out lids.	
Next time we're in downtown Vegas, we will be going to the Triple George Grill.	
It was pretty much that.	
I brought my daughter to the family restroom and there was no soap on the soap dispenser.	
I told the server of the problem with my filet and sent it back.	
Not the best slaw I've had but nothing to scoff at.	
The waitress seemed confused when we asked her for water for everyone.	
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	0
The mocha that my friend ordered was stone-cold, so cold in fact, that it made him a wee bit grumpy.	
Time will tell.	
Don't get me wrong, the people are awesome but everything is a bit slow and attention is not always paid.	
I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.	1
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.	0
which pretty much means, I probably won't have theirs again.	
At the suggestion of another reviewer, I chose the brisket sandwich and it was just about the most tender and fat free brisket I have ever had.	
Another good alternative might be Circo's big brother, Le Cirque.	
I'll disclaim, I'm not a huge fan to begin with of the "mixed meats" like Hot Dogs, Sausages, Bologna, Spam, etc.	
Is this the best sushi I ever ate?	
Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.	1
Two very big thumbs for for double up!	
It's like all the servers there not only are new to serving, but completely new to writing things down and remembering them later.	
The ambience was rustic, but the place was bustling -- but I went on Black Friday.	
The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.	1
I'll let you know how it goes....	
Last weekend my friend and I had an intense craving for Greek that neither Pita Jungle nor other places could handle.	
Redemption!!	
You have to go up to the counter to order food.	
This is the ultimate heavy hangover food and, although they could've dialed down the spice in the sauce, was tasty.	
It helped the time pass.	
If I was in the area I would go back.	
Pub Crawl, stop 2: I have been to The Library a couple of times and like it.	
For breakfast, we always get pancakes, the wrangler and a muffin, and share between two adults and a toddler.	
i ordered the plantain spring rolls and the main dish escapes me.	
There wasn't much eggplant left, and what eggplant was left didn't taste much like eggplant.	
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!	0
The service was terrible though.	0
Go to the register, pay, and take your dinner ticket to be seated.	
Our reservation was for 15 and 14 of us were there within a few minutes of each other.	
good sub shop.	
I've never been a fan of buffets and still haven't been very impressed with any of the buffets in Las Vegas.	
*clean * friendly *cheap chinese place.	
My favorite breakfast place, Ollies Omelette House.	
This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!	0
I've eaten at Bunky's for years.	
Some very good, room-temp Swiss took the flavor to a higher level, but all in all... it's a SANDWICH.	
If you check in on Yelp you get a free dessert.	
Dry and salt lamb meatballs, too much dressing, too soon poured over the greens so they were weak.	
It was packed!!	0
I just had them toss it out.	
We started off the night with a country pate that was made on-premise with seasonal ingredients.	
I ended up eating the grilled cheese, mac & cheese (YUMMY), fried chicken, and wings!	
But hey Ezekiel's I will be back again and again and again.	
Either keep up the quality or don't serve dim sum after a certain time.	
There was hardly any spinach that I had paid extra for due to the confusing menu, and I couldn't even taste the Dorito topping.	
Everything we have tried thus far has been awesome.	
For serious, though, this place is cool.	
I had the seafood one tonight and it was very tasty and extremely filling.	
Once we arrived there was a mob scene of about 30 people waiting outside and the wait was an hour.	
I've dined here three times so I know the drill.	
I love this place.	1
A bit intimidating place, but we wanted to try it because it was in the food channel.	
I can say that the desserts were yummy.	1
The food was terrible.	0
All my servers have been sweethearts too.	
The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.	1
There was a large open container of ketchup sitting on the drink station.	
You know you messed up my order then offer me to pay again for what I originally ordered.	
That rice was gone in an instant and we had to order another rice bowl.	
That's way too much personal info.	
That alone is a wonderful welcome.	
We stayed away from Coco's for a couple of years, due to HORRIBLE service at the 7th St and McDowell, and bad service @ the Priest & Elliot one.	
Awhile back Red Rock had a web site that gave me 50% my meals at various points.	
I've always wondered what a breakfast pizza would be like and I finally found out at my visit to Scramble.	
I had the opportunity to try SOL at Monday's yelp party.	
Just an okay taco.	
I am so jealous that I don't have a Ichiza in Texas to satisfy my craving for an awesome dessert.	
It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.	0
This place should honestly be blown up.	0
Saw the good reviews and thought I'd check it out for taco Tuesday.	
My only criticism is the bar.	
Soo soo good!	
Definitely not worth $43.95....There was not a huge variety, pizza?,Italian, Asian, French I think....salad/fruits, sushi.	
But I definitely would not eat here again.	0
The Palms is easy to find in the Forum shop area.	
The Torta Mexicana is what you want.	
The cut of prime beef was tender, as rare as you want it to be, and sinfully tasty.	
Why the chef couldn't make Bearnaise sauce is beyond me.	
Do not waste your money here!	0
I have been to this place over 10 times... I am sad to say the food is getting worst and worst... What gives?	
I came home and wrote this crying.	
We barely had enough food to get over being hungry.	
One star off due to an issue over the price of the wine we ordered.	
The problem seemed to be a bit worse, we even tried changing tables to see if it would help.	
It looked good.	
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.	1
So I got to experience, for the 1st time in my life, the experience of sending something back.	
Yes, please.	
This is my favorite authentic mexican food in Vegas.	
The cr√™pe was delicate and thin and moist.	1
:) The quality of the food is really good and the service was great.	
Awful service.	0
We were seated immediately, but were not given menus until we asked for one.	
Everything else was delicious and fresh!	
But it was a blistered nasty mess.	
Won't ever go here again.	0
Great way to start a Sunday with family and friends.	
Not even close.	
Our food gets to the table along with my diet coke.	
Look at my stats.	
Also at the table was a house salad of sorts, which while it has potential, went half-eaten.	
Chicken Taco/Burrito- Pretty straightforward but still good.	
Some of the highlights were the salmon with pesto cream sauce.	
We get our check.	
Come on an empty stomach.	
I've taken a few other new people here and they all liked it.	
But, occasionally, I get my hopes up for that little amazing hole in the wall.	
I order their honey chicken katsu which was on their specialty menu so I figured what the heck and two spam masubi.	
Not authentic but close enough.	
It was a lot of food.	
Food quality has been horrible.	0
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.	0
Minuto was interesting, but I wouldn't get it again.	
If our primary waiter was busy with another table, the slew of waitstaff promptly attended to our needs.	
If you want to supersize your meal and yourself hit up the McDonalds.	
The service here is fair at best.	0
They've got it covered.	
It was fan-friggin-tastic.	
I was puzzled by this restaurant/bar concept.	
Their double cheeseburger is one of the greatest things California has ever given to America.	
The bar downstairs is crazying during football days.	
I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.	0
My friends were not thrilled about their burgers.	
Finally after they were done taking care of him than they came to the table to ask for our drinks.	
Ok one more time fresh!!	
I'm praying it wasn't.	
Order Hot n Juicy sauce mild or medium.	
Andre's Lounge is a quaint, beautiful lounge- perfect for intimate conversation, great drinks and great cigars.	
lots of booth seating.	
If you are staying on the strip it is a butt turd of a drive.	
The dance floor is small, and pretty much non-existent.	
Vomit on the light switch?	
Try them out!	
Add to all that the selection of affordable wines by the glass and tasty boba smoothies and that's it, I'm hooked.	
The sushi tastes fresh and we haven't had any issues with the rolls falling apart.	
Drag your still-drunk butt out of bed!	
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.	0
Well worth the calories.	
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.	
I will go back as they seem to be improving.	
The bottom line.	
The bottom half of the bun never stood a chance and was a soggy sponge in just a few minutes.	
I'm also a fan of their Shrimp Killer and Spicy Tuna rolls.	
The restaurant interior was hip and tasteful with plenty of mood lighting.	
), the service was inexcusably slow.	
I would say the food was decent.	
Very poor service.	0
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.	0
Too bad it was a very tiny piece of short ribs.	
Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.	1
The big night out is pricy, but well worth it.	
Rip off of the year.	
It seemed glorious.	
They were excellent.	1
YOU MIGHT DIE!!!!!!!	
I was too full both times to try it when we went :)	
The menu is limited but that also means one short order cook can service the whole restaurant.	
The corned beef patties were good.	
I'm hoping my next visit will be better.	
It looks practically brand new.	
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.	0
I have a habit of becoming good friends with people who like these places.	
This was one of the worst dining experiences I have had in some time.	
Their "cheap" breakfast is $4 for 1 egg and hash browns.	
It didn't have the rubbery chewy texture but was actually juicy and tender like eating a seafood steak.	
However, I do remember my experience there.	
I noticed that the table next to us got their food a lot faster than us.	
Come early (8am) and beat the crowd.	
We finally had to ask a different server who got the manager for us.	
Also, our waiter who looked and sounded like Boris from Bullwinkle was really nice and very well informed :)	
For the price (about $50 for my wife and I @ the Sunday brunch), I expected a lot better food and service.	
I have been coming to this location for quite some time now, and this was the WORST EXPERIENCE I've ever had.	
Thin crust pizza should be CRISPY!	
I said "Excuse me, hers should be free I believe, that would make 11 meals total."	
The decor of the place was great with a perfect view of the kitchen so you can see them prepare your edible art.	
This is how a local pizza shop should run a business.	
Kinda made me regret coming here for dinner when it did was nothing to brag about.	
The whole place is one giant freezer.	
This one is definitely a diamond in the rough.	
Wait, hear me out, please?	
mmmm... cardboard parmesan.	
Just had lunch here and had a great experience.	1
The waitress interrupted me to say, "We don't make any changes to our menu items, no substitutions or subtractions."	
Kinda cool!	
I did not really find anything i enjoyed in Asain section except for the Korean BBQ Kalbi.	
It has managed to stay in business, and good on them.	
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	0
This came out steamy, hot!!!	
Maybe they added a few barstools.	
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.	0
He absolutely STUNK.	
Check out the other patrons' reviews.	
I was looking forward to having dinner here.	
I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!	1
We chose this spot on the advice of the MGM concierge, our main criteria being somewhere in walking distance that is "outside with strip view."	
The waitress apologized again, and assured us that the kitchen normally runs much smoother.	
Beef Brisket is good!	
Also the coat check is like in the very back of the club which is pretty inconvenient if you ask me.	
5mins later they comeback and say they have no more peach smoothie.	
The steak was smallish and carved table side by a disinterested woman with her hand behind her back... never smiled or said hello.	
I wanted food like nothing else.	
I loved it.	
The worst part is I love metro pizza.	
for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.	0
The food came out at a good pace.	1
I see the same core staff and smiling faces that have been there for several years, and they are happy.	
It is pretty good for a fast food item, although the fast food prices are getting a bit out of hand as this thing costs $6.99.	
(Monday nights) pool table needs some love and drinks are a little pricey but great atmosphere	
.........AND IT"S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN ....... Good Riddance	
I gave two stars because if you are looking for quantity for a decent price you will get that.	
I like the hip vibe, but for me it's all about the service and food...oh did you see me mention anything about service?	
I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.	1
I won't be back.	0
So we let him take the reigns and it was AMAZING.	
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!	0
This place deserves no stars.	0
Hamburger, medium rare was more like medium sawdust burger.	
In fact, Amando S. can make Ahi Poke better than this place!	
You could graze here and not eat another meal that day.	
I would not recommend this place.	0
The mozzarella stick appetizer was good (but the boyfriend [actually now fianc√©!]	
Then had dessert before dinner with the fried dough balls that we dipped in Nutella.	
I'm not sure if I will try the other Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix.	
Each slice had to be reheated in the oven.	
You start to relax even before the waitstaff asks for your beverage request.	
Reservations are definitely recommended for the weekend.	
I thought it was very nice, subtle, and something a little different.	
very busy on sundays there may be a wait.	
for the record we still loved it.	
The prefix menu makes the whole experience even better because you just show up!	
Sonic is a drive in fast food place.	
pepper and I was handed a small one.	
Never did any management staff come out to apologize or maybe offer to move us or something so we finished most of our meal and hit the road.	
In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome.	1
To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.	0
A server comes down and says, "your table is ready" Cool.	
Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!	0
However, it came 20 minutes after the meal was over and it was pre-ordered per their request.	
I also expected that they would make the extra effort for quality service and cleanliness.	
You could still smell him after he walked by.	
Hmm..I cannot decide if I liked it or not.	
The service was okay.	
He wasn't given an itemized receipt so I don't know why there was such a price difference.	
I went and spoke to the manager before I left.	
The next thing I realized, the baby back ribs were fried also & then some bar-b-q sauce added on top.	
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.	1
We also tried a taco al pastor just to check it out and it was dry and not flavorful at all.	
LOVE LOVE this place!!	
I should have gone to Yama Sushi.	
Like most Las Vegas hotels and casinos, Paris offers complimentary valet and self parking.	
I probably would not go here again.	0
Tone it down.	
So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.	1
The price is reasonable and the service is great.	1
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.	0
We ate until we thought we would explode, but the fun didn't end there.	
Great food, fun atmosphere.	
I found pieces of the chutney to be bitter (orange peel possibly?)	
Is it really necessary to offer 3 daily specials at a small cafe?	
0 x $20 = $0 Oh well.	
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.	0
I only gave it two stars because of the speed at which the server saw the two hockey pucks on my plate and corrected it.	
The french fries are hit and miss.	
Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.	1
Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!	1
I probably won't be coming back here.	0
This is the only Capriotti's I went to that had an actual dine in sit down area.	
Today I placed an order at 12:30pm.	
We went with the tasting menu and it was such a party on our palates!	
Oh we ran out of dark rum so I just put some more light rum in it.	
Quivey's Grove is definitely a nice Wisconsin experience.	
Delicious!!	
If you're going to splurge, this is the place to do it.	
Worst food/service I've had in a while.	0
The patio's great but it's starting to get warm (imagine that) so me & my friend grabbed a seat inside near the bar.	
I mean, c'mon, isn't sriracha Chinese hot sauce?	
Horchata was wonderful and felt like I was actually having one, but with shaved ice.	
Oh yeah, the relish plate for your fajitas?	
The food is fine - it's bowling alley food and I'm okay with that.	
Serendipity on the go is definitely not on the go.	
This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.	1
So, here's what I did.	
I'm sorry but you could have just told us about the attire policy, when we asked about eating there.	
I am lucky to have a partner who likes to share meals so we can try more stuff.	
and I do not mean your regular lettuce, with dressing and croutons etc.	
It's nice inside, with comfortable booths, as well as just right lighting, temp, & service.	
Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.	1
Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.	0
I love their fries and their beans.	1
I would definitely come back here again, this time sober.	
However, that menu is not cheap...$18 for the nachos!	
Have been here a few times for lunch.	
After hearing it was our first time they gave us samples of all the types of meats.	
Especially my friend who ordered the aracherra tacos, he thought they were dry and were definitely missing something in there.	
Guess they don't see a lot of that in here.	
I feel like the waitress was a little disappointed to see customers walking in.	
The hangover was like tamale with pork carnitas very different & good flavor big portion.	
there was a funny smell in the place when we walked in.	
Anyway....Wendy's is your traditional fast food joint.	
Everything was good.	
I've had worse, but I do expect some kind of crispness.	
I have eaten here before but not in about a year.	
We had about 5 of us, that ordered a variety of food... probably totalling over $200.	
and sorbet were delivered.	
Service: The servers are hard to understand.	
Always a pleasure dealing with him.	1
They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval.	1
Great flavor and epitome of a good cheesecurd!	
This place just doesn't do it for me.	
This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.	1
The restaurant does have a nice glass fa√ßade, which allows a pleasant view of the street.	
Why would someone ever take Kobe beef, and completely ruin it?	
This place is pretty dang good.	
A weekend of pure indulgence to say the least.	
Was it worth it?	
I will admit, my first visit here probably biased me rather severely towards this place.	
They went ALL out on this.	
My girl friend and I split one, so did her grand parents and her dad had his own.	
For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.	1
The gnocchi sauce is spicy, overwhelmingly so for me (although I do freely admit to being a hot chili wimp).	
Yelp, your mobile app has taken me home again!	
I will be back soon !	
The meatballs are half a pound each and the spaghetti dish could have fed a family of 4.	
They have a decent kids menu for $6.95 and my boys got the bbq ribs and mac and cheese.	
Probably because it's in a friend's neighbor hood, and it's a bar, and i lied about it being little.	
The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.	1
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.	0
The reason I'm not giving the place 5 stars is that the d√©cor does not match the high quality of the pizza.	
Not my first choice, but it was very tasty and the mashed potatoes were so creamy, my mouth is watering thinking about them!	
And we found out that the salad was never even written down.	
I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.	0
Will be back again soon.	
Oh well, no big deal.	
However, the veggies themselves were nothing to brag about either.	
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.	0
Lobster roll and oysters!	
Swiss cheese, ham and a beautifully done fried egg.	
I just don't look good in Affliction...or a sequined mini-dress.	
A must try if you live in the hood.Total price came to $36 for 2 people including tip and 1 beer.	
All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.	1
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.	1
I usually like to try a sampler.	
One of my favorite Thai restaurants in Las Vegas.	
Strikes 4,5 and 6.	
The beer selection is good but the prices are high.	
Met the owners at a different place and they seemed nice so decided to check it out.	
It's been more than a year since my last visit to Gordon Ramsay Steak.	
HUGE portions.	
God can you give me a list of workers who make the drinks .	
Hey Philadelphia Sandwich Company, where's the beef?!?	
The main dishes are in the region of ¬£5-8 and they have good selection of veggie dishes to.	
I must say I was absolutely amazed by the service.	
Weird vibe from owners.	0
Herby leaves, cured meats, fresh cheese drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.	
There was hardly any meat.	0
Yet these people over charge and under deliver.	
Good thing we had a groupon.	
Now on to the important stuff.	
I've had better bagels from the grocery store.	0
Probably one of the best I have ever had.	
The servers were still nice and friendly, but wow it felt like a hint hint."	
Fusilli Sausage and cabbage was very hearty with an excellent marinara sauce.	
My friend Kristina and I skipped in excitement through the doors and entered in jaw-dropping bewilderment.	
Go To Place for Gyros.	1
They did bring out nice thick homemade tortilla chips to munch on with a great chipotle salsa.	
It was a great spot for lunch with coworkers and our tummies were all happy from our meals.	
Had the french dip (17 dollars), which was pretty good.	
The servers were attractive though (again a sign that what they are selling isn't food)	
After learning my lesson from my first trip, I placed an order online for a Jack Daniel's Pecan Pie and Chocolate Cream Pie for Christmas.	
just save your money and go to Oregano's where your never disappointed I guess.	
It's a shame too.	
Food was alright	
I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!	1
Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.	0
I've been just a few times since then and it's been just okay.	
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.	0
I went on a Saturday with my boyfriend who had never had Vietnamese food.	
That explains the pricing; double each cost to compare apples to apples.	
NY steak and potato - 10 2.	
What I liked: The salt and pepper chicken wings.	
I have been going here a lot lately.	
I been to many many pho places in vegas.	
We ordered three burros (3 way, green and red I think), two soft and two hard tacos (chicken).	
The plus side, their service was GREAT!	
For me, it's definitely worth the wait.	
The service was terrible, food was mediocre.	0
Just don't expect a nice big filet coming to you.	
We definately enjoyed ourselves.	1
The chicken fried steak was a thin piece of steak and was overly breaded, then fried to the point it was too hard to crack the breading to cut it.	
Hum, I might not return again... But my husband loves the place...	
Their menu is just too expensive.	
Not too noisy and has good vibes.	
And unknowingly agreed to be charged an additional 59 cents.	
My wife enjoyed her cappuccino.	
Better not just because you can get the full menu and the food is good, but also because they don't often make mistakes.	
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.	0
It was way too big to pick up and eat without making a huge mess, and a knife and fork just don't work for a hot dog.	
Apparently they deliver as well.	
If I skipped the drink it was only $2.18 per meal.	
If I went to restaurants to be treated nicely then this place would warrant at least 4 stars.	
On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.	0
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	0
I was at this location on Sunday night (2/25/07) and it was horrible.	
I mostly don't do fast food and burgers but had an ice cream craving and remembered Wendy's has their dollar size Frosty.	
She came over to us and said that she was sorry but "athletic apparel is not allowed in the restaurant."	
The service was extremely slow.	0
After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.	0
This is the classic old-school Vegas "gourmet room" experience.	
Seriously killer hot chai latte.	1
I've lived here all my life so that's quite a few people	
The food is delicious.	
Is it really common practice to not have what you sell available?	
Our bartender, a friendly, attractive, Christina Hendricks-like blonde, thankfully rang up our drinks at the happy hour price.	
Just got back from spending the weekend in Vegas.	
Granted, we could have made reservations, but I didn't think it would be necessary.	
There is a special 6-item bar food menu with prices ranging from $5 to $7.	
My daughters told me about LBS @ Redrock Station.	
Decided to check out Ground Control last night based on a reviews on AZ Central as one of the best wine bars.. I totally disagree.	
Coffee was nothing special, but then, I don't go to restaurants for the coffee.	
No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.	0
So it tricks you into thinking the food will be amazing.	
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.	1
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.	1
Not served as described on their menu.	
The squid inside however, was high quality, not chewy, and tender.	
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.	0
Prosciutto was mediocre; the lack of creativity begins to seep in our impressions as the dish is improperly paired with poorly cooked crostini.	
For the people that complain about the price for good Japanese food.	
We ventured into the restaurant which was mostly empty and headed outside.	
Worst Thai ever.	0
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.	1
Its a decent dance club, but no where close to being as nice as Xs.	
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.	1
Once again I learned people from other parts of the world sometimes have a fascination with the American west.	
I wanted to love this place.	
The pizza selections are good.	1
And not just the folks who worked there.	
This place has gluten free pizza and uses daiya cheese.	
The sauce was drenched when she got it.	
That's when your little buddies post pictures of restaurant dishes on Facebook.	
Some people have mentioned that the place wasn't very clean.	
If I could, I'd give it a 4.5 stars...	
I had the California egg-crepe with swiss cheese, bacon, guacamole, tomato, mushroom, and a side of hollandaise.	
I had strawberry tea, which was good.	1
So after 4 days of constant bombardment, before heading off to the airport on day last, I decided to give Hooters a try.	
I've visited both during the day for lunch and in the evening for a night on the town.	
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!	0
Four of us arrived at 5pm, and we were expecting 2 more.	
Not at all runny.	
It was so amazing Haha The plating and presentation of the food was appetizing and appealing too.	
Before our food came our waiter gave us tiny glasses of sparlking apple cider.	
Overall, a great experience.	1
I never had an anchovy in my life until I came here.	
Spend your money elsewhere.	0
Gotta try the chorizo carnitas skillet!	
The coke was OK but crazy expensive ($3.60).	
Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!	1
My last night in Vegas and after a week of attending a conference for work, I decided I'd earned a nice meal.	
We also ordered some nigiri and a couple of rolls.	
Had reservations and was seated right away but had to wait 30 mins just for drinks and over hr for food.	
She ended up comping a drink but that did not nearly cover the almost $40 difference between the bottle we ordered and the bottle we received.	
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.	0
The rolls were sloppily put together, small, plus they only gave you eight rolls considering the average price was about $17.	
First - the service was really excellent.	
The ranch tasted watered down also.	
It says on the menu "cheeseburger" but it's a double cheeseburger.	
We are "regulars" there and are never disappointed!	
And the drinks are WEAK, people!	0
It had a sign that said "Shy Guy".	
* Perhaps it's better on different night.	
I came as part of a large group for a celebration.	
-My order was not correct.	0
Ordered veal parm, got chicken.	
If I did return to the Marriott for a meal, it would be for the brunch buffet at Blue Sage instead.	
Both came with plantains, rice & beans and steamed cabbage.	
Don't get me wrong, they're good, but you really don't get an idea of what alligator tastes like based on this.	
we started with the frog legs and lobster egg rolls.	
The server quickly arrived to take my drink order while handing me the menu.	
Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.	0
The bread tasted old and came out of a plastic bag.	
Solid brunch place!	
The bar downstairs is okay.	
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	0
Simply amazing taco salads and smothered burritos.	
You offer sweet potato fries?	
she had to come get you 3 times!!!	
I love the innovative use of the storage container to house an entire restaurant, it is a way to "upcycle" or use something old in an innovative way.	
They advertise on their to-go menu, "IT'S THE BEST, HEALTHY, ALWAYS FRESH!".	
Ok, it really doesn't extend out that far... but it sure does seem like it.	
Daughter's steak was apparently chewy.	
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
We won't be returning.	0
i know where sushi roku is located (arizona) for those who forget.	
Yet every other table had a regular glass with ice water.	
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.	1
The place is pretty tiny but there was no wait for lunch on a Sunday.	
I second the hit-and-miss service--we had to ask for more water, and for our check.	
I am in love!	
On the way out one of the servers suggested if we love the beef roll to get the pork pockets next time.	
You'd be better off going to Hometown Buffet.	
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.	0
Can't wait to return!	
3 dishes?).	
No mention of beer style or hops... just darkness.	
They have some of the best pizza I've had.	
I wish my server offered me some of the other things that I was seeing.	
My overall experience is DEFINITELY 5 stars and I'd go back any time.	
I cannot believe the following message that I received from the owner of this place.	
My verdict?	
But this didn't happen while I was there.	
Got a small thin crust margherita, and a works deep dish with an order of jalapeno poppers...honestly, all a disappointment.	
If you just need a quick lunch it's probably okay to go here, but NEVER go here at 3pm-4pm.	
Asked if someone out sick?	
(~$13 for lunch - 2 sliders and super fries) They add $2 if you order the Mystery Burger as one of your burgers in the 2/$5 deal.	
We got there perfect timing.	
The flavors are so fresh and work well.	
The two other people that I were with ordered a meatball sandwich.	
Chicken & Waffles (****-Kathy's rating... she's pretty easy.	
Don't go if your hungry.	
Very, very sad.	0
The apple & beet salad was yummy!	
This was a surprise birthday party for a dear old friend.	
We had the crab lettuce wraps, shrimp satay & mushrooms/brussel sprouts for appetizers.	
My southwestern burger was too gooey with cheese and green chile and pork rinds(!)	
Stopped in for a few appetizers and had a nice time.	
At $8 it's a good deal because your eating rib eye that is filled with plenty of flavor.	
Service was average.	
Pomo occupies the space formerly used by Thai Thai.	
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?	0
(place was packed).	
Pesce: MEDITERRANEAN BRANZINO- You can never go wrong with this fish.	
Definitely no need syrup for these bad boys.	
It's nice lil spot for people watching and you'll see a lot ;- /	
It seemed, "like-pretty good".	
Overall if the food was cooked better the way we wanted it I would rate it higher.	
A co worker was in town and he was try to fine a reasonable steak house "Bulls Eye".	
The waiter suggested a mimosa, and the meal was on.	
She was a very nice, slightly older woman.	
How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!	0
The service staff are primarily young people and, as some have said, maybe a little bit rough, but I notice it getting better all the time.	
C'mon when your eatin good italian food you want the passion that belongs with the Italian spirit I know the owners have.	
They have always strived to make the dining experience shine.	
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.	0
By the way the zucchini fries were awesome.	
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it pur√©ed.	0
Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it'll do in a pinch.	
That said, this chain is consistently good.	
To start with there is salad, veg fritters and chaat (north indian snack).	
We've been coming here for 2 years, for breakfast and lunch.	
Red Devil is fantastic.	
There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better	0
And whatever they do to their broth, it has a much richer flavor, much similar in the sense that the right broth makes miso soup or ramen excellent.	
Try their excellent appetizers, the antipasto salad, the shrimp scampi and the grilled chicken linguine.	
What deserves 1-2 stars: - Service from waitstaff.	
What this means is that innocent people were unwittingly eating low sodium soy sauce.	
Might be a bit much for a party of two.	
Anywho, the wings were cheap, $6.50 a dozen with carrots and ranch.	
I also had Shrimp Shumai, which was very doughy.	
No value here.	
this time she didn't get "too" picky.	
The Bobbi, nothing special, just a little underwhelming for a cold sandwich.	
Got home and my son bites into an egg roll and it's cold.	
I'd love to see Peoria as the home to more restaurant debuts like this!	
BUT, it did have a nice outdoor patio looking out on the strip and the Bellagio fountains.	
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.	0
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!	0
Their pizza is alright and cheap but we won't be ordering it when we're in town again due to the bad service.	
We ordered from Joey's instead -- 4 pies and an order of garlic balls.	
It's family owned, and has been running successfully for 30 years now!	
That being said, the food makes up for it.	
I'll definitely be back if I'm in the area!	
Our meals were delicious and made up for the not so good appetizer.	
Service here is quick and they speak a multitude of languages.	
What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.	0
Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.	0
I had read the reviews about Maggiano's catering to their gluten free patrons and looked forward to our visit.	
This place is disgusting!	0
Get ready to drink as they often shove vodka on you for free.	
The only good part about this restraunt is it is disgusting enough to cure a hangover!!!	
The Pluses: Great menu.	
One glaring thing that I always notice is that the manger never seems to be in a jovial or even in a pleasant mood and it shows.	
I ordered a BV blend for 45.00, and when the waiter brought out a BV Tapestry I told him that had to be the wrong one.	
As Peggy mentioned in her prior review, probably not the cheapest place.	
Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.	1
We got the players!	
But at that price who knows what you might find in your food.	
The RI style calamari was a joke.	0
The decor was poor, the beer was warm, the service was poor, and the "fish fry" was right out of the frozen box.	
The trout was very good.	
Did not happen but I still enjoyed them.	
I did not say anything it was my guest who brought this point up to me.	
I haven't tried the other food items they have on the menu so this is strictly boba and shaved ice review.	
for what...tap water??	
However, they changed their happy hour to 10% off instead of 50, that I was okay with because I loved it here.	
Lemon curd was served in crisp cookie shells with a raspberry drizzle, fresh blueberries and a mound of whipped cream.	
Our server was awesome as she seemed so giddy and just happy to be at work.	
However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.	0
Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese.	
Shut the front door are you kidding me.... What a gem I was so surprised.	
I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.	0
Recently it was our first stop after getting off the plane at 8pm.	
anyway.... So I ask for the manager, and say: "is this low sodium soy sauce?"	
One of my lucky companions dare to order yet another beer and arrive 15 mins later... I think I never got mine.	
It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.	0
4) Shrimp tempura with ponzu-mandarin orange dipping sauce - crispy, golden, tempura perfection with a superb sweet-salty-tangy dipping sauce.	
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.	0
While I was paying I chatted with the cashier who asked how I heard about them.	
And, good luck finding Slidin Thru HQ - as of 3/9/11 there is no outdoor signage.	
The fried rice was OK, except for the occasional piece of cartilage.	
From the start of our meal, the timing of service was a combination of long waits, no explanation of the course and sub par food.	
In this place, who could ask for more?	
Once inside you realize this is going to go one of two ways, and obviously based on all previous reviews it went the right way.	
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!	0
The tacos were good sized, well priced and made to order.	
Disappointing experience.	0
So delicious!	
Great restaurant!	
Love this place.	
The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.	0
I ordered the #12 vegetarian and my dad ordered the #38 club.	
I couldn't even look at another food after the meal we had.	
I forget what my Son had but he agreed with my husband that the food was just good but nothing he could not get at home.	
I tried the Montague and the Caribbean Chicken Jerk.	
We were seated in a lovely booth with high ceiling and cascading curtains.	
After attending a conference all day, my friends and I were too wiped out to drive.	
I love the marrying of different flavors, cultures, and ingredients; the unpretentiousness, that is what food is all about.	
My friend and I came here for dinner, and while the atmosphere was nice, and the service was good, the food left a lot to be desired.	
My friend had one of the steaks and I tried a little, it was amazing, totally melt in your mouth delicious.	
With better service, I would have probably rated 3 stars.	
I would definitely eat it again, but not with the same...smack-your-grandma-for-another-serving-gusto that I felt with the dates.	
The flat panels all over the place showing sports, the hearty portions - it's very manly.	
If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.	0
Well we did go back and i will tell you what happened in my next review.	
My husband and I went to Red Robin after attending the movies nearby on May 24, 2013.	
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.	0
Great service!	
Bad ones too.	
The menu didn't look too bad though, $-wise.	
They have a zillion new items and it is tough to decide, but everything new seems to include mango.	
Taking any basic Garde Manger class will teach you that if there's salad dressing left on the plate, or in the bowl, there is too much.	
Great, you think.	
I would have sent it back but who knows how long that would have taken.	
Saw this place on The Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Had.	
I also spied a chocolate layer cake, and what?	
Probably 2 mins later our waiter came with our drinks FINALLY.	
Whether the establishment has succeeded for its average patron is subject to debate.	
The attention to detail is unmatched down to the cucumber mint water and the music played.	
We won't be going back.	0
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.	0
Ambience: 7 Food Quality: 8 Selection: 8 Service: 5 I'm the type to try a little of everything.	
Sat down got our drinks and ordered.	
This place lacked style!!	0
Someone needs to hand them a dictionary with the term highlighted.	
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.	0
This place was way better when it was Cabo.	
And there is a protein for everyone: chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, squid, marinated or non marinated.	
Very impressed.	
Don't bother coming here.	0
I feel like Serendipity is one of those places that you have to try at least once when you're in Vegas.	
Pros: - Warm pistachios when you sit down - Fresh french fries (yes, one of my 4 food groups) - Steak anything.	
Just need a pickle on the side and I'm set.	
She took her sweet time shambling around the restaurant.	
As is the norm with the Buffalo Wild Wings chain, the food was great.	
This is my go-to spot for good, authentic, and cheap Thai food, not to mention their portions are huge!	
The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.	0
The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.	0
As to the menu....To begin with every single appetizer on the menu involved seafood.	
It was equally awful.	0
It took up less then a quarter of the pan.	
Add in great coffee and this is a great little brunch spot.	
Specifically the Chicken Wings, it's a roll of the dice wether your wings will be undercooked and slimy or overlooked and dry.	
As we were waiting for the order, the cashier said she forgot to ask if I wanted some other things.	
Probably not in a hurry to go back.	0
If you ever find yourself in Vegas, you must make sure to stop at the landmark that is the Peppermill Inn Restaurant.	
That wasn't the case here.	
very slow at seating even with reservation.	0
On the plus side...Military discount..but not much.	
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.	0
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.	0
I was iffy to try this place because on the outside it looked kinda ghetto but I'm SO glad we did because the food is SO tasty!	
This place definitely lives up to the hype.	
Pluses: skewers and chopped salad with spicy dressing were good.	
I got 2 bowls of soup and an amazingly delicious iced coffee for my friend and I for 13 bucks!	
Strike 7...see where this is going?	
I've ordered the craw fish and shrimp with lemon pepper medium hotness very yummy, and also the hot and juicy special sauce spicy!	
The Yellow Pork Curry was ordered mild.	
The taquitos were burned, served with a lump of so so guacamole.	
The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.	0
It was soft and the sauce was creamy and so tasty!	
She delivered the drinks and appetizers yet there were no plates nor silverware and napkins on the table.	
I can deal with that.	
It was one of the best steaks I've ever eaten, no joke.	
It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.	0
Thai rolls - way to bread-ey.	
I was VERY disappointed!!	0
I think I would rather have Ragu!!	
She got the rest of our order and left.	
This place is horrible and way overpriced.	0
However, I feel that if a restaurant can justify their prices with flavor and quality, then it's worth it.	
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.	0
Tonight I was handed off between two employees for my order.	
Only good things was the salad and the cappuccino.	
The world would be a much better place if more people were like them.	
I mean, it was just "okay."	
The trashcans were overflowing and the floor looked dirty.	
We were in Las Vegas last week and went to Fatburger 2 separate times.	
It tasted like it had american cheese in it...strange?	
This was one of the worse pizza's I have had threw the store I had about 2 slices with this one thats it .	
I had never had custard before (gasp from the gallery, I know) so I wanted to try that before I left.	
I cannot wait to head back and experience the meat here.	
Burger, Fries and Drink super cheap.	
I thought to myself, "Why did I ask?	
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.	0
I couldn't wait to try it out, and knowing it opened just TO-DAY...I jumped at the opportunity.	
The rainbow wrap was delicious, fresh and filling.	
if you dont like uni say so!!	
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.	0
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.	0
Absolutely perfect in every way!	
I chose this place to have a "rest" from the steak meals that the husband required on our recent trip.	
Based on fellow Yelpers recs, we checked this place out on our last Vegas trip.	
We ordered drinks, I a soda, my nephews soda and the last a water no lemon.	
And by tasty i mean NOM.	
We ordered Cheese Crisps.	
Love the service.	
2nd hand smoke is just as bad as taking a hit yourself.	
The rest of the dinner a seafood pasta was just okay.	
I'll update when we get a chance to eat there again.	
My friends and I decided to get a whole pizza with 5 toppings.	
HB had her Udon Noodles and Edamame (these come UNsalted).. I ordered Ahi Poke (This had cucumber salad, seaweed salad and small pieces of Ahi tuna.	
I was really disappointed; it tasted so bad I didn't finish it and I didn't desire a doggy bag to save it.	
Still, it beats waiting in line for the buffet.	
Definitely better Thai in town.	
The other 2 times I went there were not planned, but same basic experience each time.	
Con: spotty service.	0
Even the salad was fresh and I don't think it was prepackaged, as many pizza places do.	
Six croutons on the side and some other "stuff".	
The sauce on the Pecan roll slices was perfectly caramelized from the french toast preparation and the syrup was just enough to add to the taste.	
Great food at amazing prices.	
Food was good, thinly sliced, but good.	
Love that they give you dough to play with b4 your meal.	
Will return to again and again when we visit Vegas :)	
If that is common, they need more wait and kitchen staff.	
We ordered some sushi.	
Cyclo has the best seafood crab soup!	
The Gaucho chefs that prepare the food are actually trained in Brazil.	
When we sit in the bar area, it's not as good.	
The service is very friendly, all the waitresses are in 1950's outfits like you would expect.	
The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.	0
And that is a win in my book.	
I also had the French toast w honey, marscapone cheese and grated apple.	
The food was top notch and the presentation was astounding.	
But then they came back cold.	0
Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.	0
There are alot of great choices for Mexican food in the Phoenix area.	
I think you will enjoy it.	
I pushed the onions to the side, and got some of the chicken.	
Great ambience but..really meager pour on martinis.	
I do take out once a week for dinner.	
The scallops were very large, beef tender with no fat or toughness and the chicken was the same.	
To my surprise, I was not disappointed in the food, but I didn't care for the wait.	
Second, our waiter was flat-out weird.	
Service was friendly so no complaints there.	
The real disappointment was our waiter.	0
My only concern in Brewdog Edinburgh was the staff.	
You know a place where you can get a steak dinner or a french toast breakfast with actual eggs at a drive thru?	
with the shittiest tone of voice you can muster and her head indignantly shaking at me like I just spit in her face.	
Good times had by all.	
I know the female manager was just trying to do her job, but seriously tact training is required.	
Pluses: nada damn thing.	
The pork com tam we had was just a generic pork chop flavored with lemongrass and grilled.	
This buffet was recommended to us by one of our taxi drivers.	
That said, this shop is very good at what it does.	
The menu is nearly intimidatingly (I don't think that's really a word) large, with both raw and cooked options.	
Unfortunately for us, it was packed with people having a great time and taking advantage of said fantastic menu and prices.	
Selection and recipes of burgers are out of this world.	
The food was average.	
The bennies here are like a deep fried large pocket of air (almost like a pita pocket) with little to no crispness.	
Another first "cafe" that I've been to that downright told me to leave.	
They opened right down the street from my in laws and we are there all the time.	
But for the price-O MY!!!	
One thing about the steak though: I don't know if the steak chef is color blind, or if he simply does not give a flying caboodle.	
I'd give the sushi 4 out of 5.	
All in all, I'd rather go to the one on Rainbow and Sahara.	
The so called champagne toast was BS - they only gad enough for half of the guest and even came out too late with it anyways.	
It's not fancy, just solid delicious food.	
That pizza looks godsend when you're intoxicated.	
I would frequent this business.	
The biggest disappointment were the ribs.	
I've been traveling to different so called Hawaiian influenced plate lunch places in the area and thus far they are only 'OK'.	
But I found me a real strong contender if not winner!	
They later explained why they falsely accused us in front of other customers of trying to steal there food but no apology.	
Since it came down to that I'd choose the M even though its inconveniently located off the strip.	
Where was the flavor??	
I am always hesitant to try new places or to just stop in somewhere new without knowing what I am walking into first.	
We all ordered and shared our meals.	
The food was really good.	
I was here for lunch and the dining room was darker than most other restaurants are for dinner.	
Their Honey Brick Toast totally got me!!	
Oh man, this place rocked in all respects to Mexican food!	
Met the owner and cook....both very nice conscientious people.	
The food is very good.	
Clearly ranking among the best if not THE best steakhouse in the Chandler area.	
I suppose wagamama caters to local taste, but if I could describe wagamama ramen in one word, it would be tasteless.	
Friendly staff.	
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.	0
I was not even going to give this place a star.	
We walked in and walked right back out because they obviously had a problem with there plumbing.	
a little tabasco sauce, and i had one bomb breakfast.	
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.	0
No only that but the beef-like-substance was friggin' grey.	
He posted on his facebook page, and I quote "Who'd have thunk that Phoenix would have the most authentic cheesesteak I've had since leaving Philly?"	
Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.	0
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?	0
So glad I found this place.	
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.	0
Went in last Sat afternoon about 3:45.	
After a long wait, the server brought us our drinks, in a red solo cup, and my coke was not coke, but RC Cola... So far, its not going well.	
Amongst 5 people, we managed to rent 2.	
If you're going to waste your product, you could have given it to us... Either way it's costing you.	
At the same time we never see our waitress again that night.	
Good, solid Itallian food.	
Heard a couple bad stories about a rude server there, whatever.	
I'm thinking this is going to be a tradition of mine when HH'ing in OTS.	
Overall, I loved the quirky Mexican decor and the staff seemed really nice.	
The calamari has a tangy sauce poured on top with mixture vegetable including good tomatoes and sweet plantains.	
I know how much work goes into a operating a restaurant why would you add cleaning a fish tank and the expense.	
My 5 y/o niece is on a special diet and had just eaten so we explained that she would not be dining.	
We keep trying to give cibo the benefit of the doubt but we are running low on chances as of now.	
But my lobster had the not so faint smell of ammonia.	
I would recommend it.	
So I proceeded to cut through the crust to check the doneness of the steak.	
It was melt-in-your-mouth type of meat and the portions were alright for the price.	
Perhaps the Olive Mill is using day old bread???	
It took forever to get our food so when the order finally came, we put in our second oder.	
They have a good options for their main entrees.	
I ordered take out, but really I felt it was way over priced for what I got.	
I have to rate their Tonkatsu Ramen my fav dish for 2010 and trust me, considering i eat out at least 7 meals/ week, it takes a lot to rate so high.	
I know I'll be making it a recent stop.	
The gumbo was good.	
The pizza was crisp but not too crisp, the crust was nice and fluffy.	
Prices were very reasonable and the portions were large - about $45 for two entrees, drinks, and an appetizer.	
No big deal.	
My son in law ordered a Bloody Mary that we affectionately called a bloody tinkerbell and the marguerita we called the sour lemonade.	
It was great.	
The service was great and the girl that helped us was very attentive.	
The decor is beautiful; more modern and trendy than many Pita Jungles I've been to, but in an awesome way.	
Everything I've eaten there is of the finest quality, resembling the perfect blend of taste and presentation.	
The Tacos Blah!	
For dessert we had the chocolate tart--delicious.	
Some stand out dishes are the seafood diavola, osso bucco and the margherita pizza.	
needs a good scouring.	
A lunch place for the blue bloods and blue hairs of Phoenix.	
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!	0
I ordered their well vodka for a martini and it was a 3oz pour, which is pretty small.It was $7.	
Sorry, Obama, and sorry to everyone else who gave this place a decent review.	
I cant wait to try a pork pocket!	
It's just good.	
But once inside, instantly charmed.	
He apologizes as he just happened to be the owner (surprise).	
The food is mediocre and is replenished very slowly.	
It was a good size drink (meaning I got a whole can of red bull not just half) hard to mess that one up.	
Unless your into deep fried bananas,deep fried doughnuts or some boring pudding and slop serve.	
This definitely goes on my list of places to impress your palate, and/or your date.	
Hands down, one of the best dining experiences in Vegas.	
i also asked for a lemon for my water.	
There's also a great big patio with heaters and a nice social bar.	
I hope the owner sees this and does something about it.	
My family has ordered a meal for a take-out a few weeks ago and the portion size was Huge and had many sides.	
Totally unacceptable experience we had.	
The little bit of the lake that we could see was, well, pretty lame.	
Seriously!?	
I had a caprese (sp?)	
The service was fine, as the restaurant was nearly empty.	
The menu looks just like cliche but the real dishes they have are fairly decent.	
Absolutely perfect!	
I asked him where the locals eat that is far away from all the dopey SEC frat boy tourists.	
Or risk it and order something else.	
There was a DJ, beer pong, ping pong, corn hole, a waterfall, and a bar.	
However, the seafood is not as fresh as it could be.	
This was when the real wait started.	
I think there's better service at a PT's...	
It didn't have a strong bite to it, but you can definitely taste it.	
For a fast food restaurant it took 45 minutes to get our order because they literally fix one ticket at a time.	
Halume is a goat cheese, which was lightly fried, but not breaded, so it was just browned.	
foccacia served in the cast iron pan it was baked it.	
If you're from another nation and want a taste of The Non-Vegan American west, stop by Big Apple fer some grub.	
This cafe should do very well and a nice addition for the downtown neighbors.	
We usually have a rice dish on the table too.	
From sandwiches to pastries to the better butter (peanut butter sandwich cookie) and oh oh (Ho-Ho), we devoured every last crumb.	
Save your money and time.	
Located in the Green Valley Resort & Spa!	
There were at least two instances where someone took my drink order, and then I never saw he or she again -- and certainly didn't receive my drinks.	
I am not a huge seafood person, but the ahi tuna was really good, a great "vehicle for flavor" as my boyfriend said.	
By far the worst dining experience any of us have ever had and it lasted over TWO HOURS.	
That pretty much explains the best attribute of the Double Barrel Roadhouse in 4 words.	
I kept seeing plate after plate brought out to my neighbors.	
The drinks are good, especially the Mango Tamarind Martini.	
The one concession made to American tastes is in the variety of toppings.	
I had two carne asada tacos, one chicken, one fish.	
The server was very attentive.	
You have to enter through Poker Paradise bar/lounge entrance and hang a right...	
My son's however was really yummy.	
Ribs were fairly dry with the mac n cheese and coleslaw being more enjoyable.	
did you tell your waitres?	
This is a very, very good chicken sandwich.	
I've been to this place a bunch of times, as I used to live right next door.	
tasted like sour chunks.	
A good place to go if you want to order a plethora of other non-Vietnamese type dishes, but if you're looking for a good bowl of pho, look elsewhere.	
This review is only of the cafe', as that was all I experienced.	
There are tons of great restaurants at the outlet mall down the street.	
My husband and I go about once per week and we haven't even come close to trying everything on the menu.	
-Waitress was a really nice girl, but the food and drink ordering was very poorly orchestrated.	
All in all, i like the subs and the prices were fine.	
In the mood for nachos?	
1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business.	
Each time I've been in this place, it was empty, which is kind of sad because the food here is SO GOOD and made with much love.	
When the restaurant officially opened at 5:30pm, the hostess took down the red rope and let us in.	
I think I'll just stick with the Sammy's on Sunsent in Hendes from here on out though.	
For two people, we were easily out the door for under $15 with plenty of food.	
Everyone talks about Bouchon like it's the all mighty creator of macaroons.	
Parking is tight, and even if you're lucky enough to find a spot in front, good luck getting out of it.	
Yep, it appears closed for good.	
JUST LEFT Kaizen.	
Also I had chosen this restaurant because the website says they have mariachi Thursday through Saturday.	
They messed up my order and would not replace it, after they initially said they would!	
Not impressed!	
That is when I stormed out and told the host up front that I had not even been acknowledged.	
We saw there was one pizza on the buffet line and asked if they would be making more to put out.	
Sometimes they get crazy busy and it takes a while to get your food but that's because everybody knows the food is worth the wait!	
A must do if you are in Gilbert.	
Luckily everything that came out of the kitchen was fabulous.	
We went here early on a weekday afternoon.	
We got in line at about 8:40 and it took up probably 40 mins to get in from the line up.	
Everything fresh, organic, non-gmo & most importantly, TASTY!	
Made that morning.	
Greasy chips Weird, sour ceviche No ability to do a blended drink other than their pre-made mixed stuff they keep in a slushie machine.	
The frog legs were incredible, I could not believe how juicy they were.	
Probably when I have guests from out of town and someone else is driving so I can enjoy lots of red wine while I wait.	
This was my second visit for dinner using a CityCoups.com coupon.	
This is due mostly to the fact that the vegetables had become saturated in the grease from the mozzarella cheese.	
I ordered the spinach enchiladas and got a bland enchilada with barely cooked button mushrooms and hardly a shred of spinach!	
I would come here again but only with my brother.	
Otherwise, the food was only okay.	
I can't usually eat that many carbs in one sitting but I nearly ate the whole plate in one sitting.	
The only thing "Chicago style" at Oregano's is the time it takes to get your pizza once it's been ordered.	
But now we here, lets give a shot.	
Meh, it's alright, but don't come in expecting a lot, because it's just fast food!	
Not to mention you couldn't stack them on top of eachother because there wasn't a more rigid surface on top of the container.	
It's not salt water.	
Chef: This was teppanyaki, but the chef never made eye contact with us.	
I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business.	
Probably go elsewhere next time.	
The crust was cooked nicely, with some tasty pepperoni, sausage and basil.	
The slices are HUGE, especially the lunch special, which by the way is only 2.99.	
Hit up Satori on Saturday through Mondays night and you won't leave disappointed.	
:-) Next time the Nutella Napoleon has my name all over it.	
Found it unusual that they had to find some soy sauce in the backroom but employee brought some out.	
China Ridden Hard And Put Away Wet.	
On the other hand, while the d√©cor is nice and pleasant - typical Jamaican with it's yellow and green walls, the place is noisy.	
Granted, there was ethnic variety with Indian, Chinese, Mediterranean, etc.	
The chicken pasta salad and chicken shawarma can't be beat, and the prices are very reasonable.	
All in all we decided we would return.	
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.	0
You can never really go wrong at Lawry's!	
Unconventional!!	
Chips & salsa came and I'm not a big fan of the burnt flavor Roberto's salsa that they serve.	
For a really amazing buffet experience, I suggest the Wynn.	
All said though, I'll go back.	
Just a declaration of my experience the one day, the one time I tried it.	
I don't get what genre their appealing to either and what is all that weird signage crap on the walls?	
I can wear jeans and a t-shirt or a dress with heels and don't feel out of place either way.	
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.	0
But I don't like it.	0
He turned his back to me and walked away with no reply.	
Let me preface this review by stating that I have been to Jersey MIkes before and actually quite enjoy the food.	
We had a gift certificate to this place off of our player's cards.	
But when we moved here to Vegas, it's been quite a challenge looking for good dim sum.	
Second the chips and salsa are okay.	
We went for breakfast before we hit the road to go back home.	
when the apps came, the protion size was smaller the usual.	
They are HANDS DOWN MY FAVORITE pizza place!!!!	
Great tasting chili with nacho cheese sauce on the top of some shoestring fries.	
Hell no will I go back	0
Delicious meat, loved the horseradish spread, which wasn't too strong, and the bread was just the right amount of crunchy.	
It's pho, not pad thai.	
Your meal comes with a variety of vegetable side dishes served in small bowls for all to share.	
The antipasto tray was nice.	
Like are you fucking kidding me.	
Totally awesome business in my eyes!	
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.	0
I ordered my norm, chili cheese hot dog and chili chesses fries.	
The Pad tai was really bad, I couldn't even eat half.	
BEWARE - HUGE serving sizes.	
Purchase a Group-On Wings- Wings cooked well-on the other hand the flavor garlic parmesan tasted more like fettuccine alfredo.	
Oh it was so good.	
Bollywood Sahara I atmosphere was nice but not everything is what it seems.	
I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back "ya'all".	0
Solid all around.	
I once was a faithful patron of this purveyor of the 'California Greek' experience but I've since tucked it away in the "meh" folder.	
the pizza crust aspires to have that NYC crisp on the outside and chewy wet on the inside mouth feel.	
My Shrimp Tempura roll was good.	
We were in the mood for chicken and waffles, however when we ordered, they kept saying the waffle maker was "broken" and it would be a while.	
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.	0
My fav AYCE in Las Vegas!	
My assumptions were not wrong.	
Overall- FOOD: 3/5 Tasty.	
The two types of salads were fresh tasting and good.	
In terms of price, quality and experience I rate Ichiza 4 stars based on what you can find in Las Vegas.	
Dined: 2008-07-06 After watching Ka, my brother and I wanted a late night snack.	
3 different kind rolls all in one plate.	
- Manga Burger - crab and scallop dyanmite on a 7 oz.	
Well, most of it.	
I saw no "please wait to be seated" or "seat yourself" signs displayed.	
Really cool.	
Outstanding.	
We ordered a som tum and got a coleslaw with raisins!	
The fancy atmosphere and menu ingredients will always lure in the yuppies who think they're some sort of culinary authority.	
once you sit down someone will bring some chips.	
Our first visit was for a very late lunch or early dinner.	
The food here is always AMAZING.	
The pizza was GREAT!!	
The ambiance isn't much better.	0
When we spoke to the manager about this, he just said that's how they run things and that 30-40 minutes is a normal wait time.	
The hostess had no other alternative than to drink in another section.	
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.	0
We had to step over kids and backpacks to get to the host stand.	
The food wasn't good.	0
The food is definitely the best mediterranean I've had in the valley.	
Food was fantastic, as was the coffee.	
All in all, 5 dishes and 7 drinks ran us about $150.	
I eat at the Scottsdale Humble Pie frequently, I really think this new one kicks butt.	
Will not be going to this filthy place again.	
Great Christmas Eve dining experience.	
I had an absinthe and with all the fancy prep, it didn't really taste all that fancy.	
If they food wasn't that good here, but the service was decent, I'd even give a better rating.	
I would like everyone to keep in mind that most authentic Vietnamese restaurants aren't going to be very upscale and /or clean.	
And my favorite part: they pile the salad high.	
old balsamic ($31) smallish portion, good taste, but the consistency of the filling was like baby food... fail.	
Think about what you're paying for and demand better.	
I will say that the dipping sauce that accompanies the fries is delicious!	
Next time we will sample some things off of the Tapas side of the menu.	
Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.	0
There's a buffet that's been on my mind...all the time Stu-Stu-Studio!	
I can't get over it!	
What I loved: The desert rotis.	
What can I say??	
I've eaten here before and it was okay, I would prefer Olive Garden if given the choice of chain Italian.	
What happened next was pretty....off putting.	0
too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.	0
Super Yummy.	
You can't go wrong.	
Even the manager was serving drinks and running food.	
The chow fun tasted mostly of soy sauce.	
Meanwhile I struggled my way through the soft crab sandwich, but I now wish I didn't as it is not sitting well.	
Now, it just seems old and a bit beat up.	
Overpriced for what you are getting.	0
The only problem, that was really our problem not theirs, is that they separated the bills but added 20% tip and failed to tell us that.	
By the time I get to the register it's 10:30 and I am told I can't order breakfast even though I was in line before 10:30.	
Black bean and garlic sauce was my favorite.	
One who brought my food to the table.	
I have never tried anything here that I didn't like.	
My whole wheat bread tasted old and stale.	
There's also a mechanical bull for those into that sort of thing.	
If you're on the edge, I recommend this Pita Jungle for dinner tonight.	
Typical Filipino Buffet style entrees.	
This was annoying because A) my boyfriend does not eat seafood and B) its fricken Arizona people!	
Not as spicy as I like, but still good and definitely not to salty as some sauces like this can be.	
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.	0
I asked her to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being amazing and 1 being awful.	
My friends got the garlic chicken and they felt a little skimped on their plates.	
Wendy's Noodle Cafe is not like your other Chinese restaurants.	
I've sworn off coming here since last year and haven't been back since.	
Dined at the Coal Burger for the first time last night in Chandler AZ.	
He started to argue and be very rude to me as I was asking to see where it said I had to pay this ?	
I ended up eating it all even though I was pretty full.	
It was not very crowded.	
Our waitress was a nice gal, and we thanked her for working on Christmas Eve.	
$100 for 2 people and no cocktails.	
The bathroom was funny.	
Not bad, just different.	
My sister chose this restaurant.	
I went for the green one.	
But even though the salad came late my wife could care less about how late it was because it was so delicious.	
... Really liked this Burger King & will return for sure!	
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.	0
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.	0
What about a bun?	
Do people even drink Corona after the age of 18???	
They are a favorite of mine and will definitely be a favorite of many soon!	
He asked if we needed anything else and I asked for some tartar sauce and ketchup for my fries.	
Or watching TV, which there is none of in the restaurant.	
And wouldn't one expect to find a plethora of ketchup at a place the sells hot dogs?	
for the price, and if you have a small group, i'd recommend it.	
Did our server offer to bring us bread or anything since she screwed up our order and we were starving?	
Our server was super nice and attentive.	
As I repeatedly ducked he narrowly missed my head head with the metal support to the parasol two or three times.	
My boyfriend ordered the Houston burger with an egg and grilled onions, also with cheese fries.	
BTW - I only rate the cost at $$ - very reasonably priced for the value.	
We ordered three or four dishes each and enjoyed every bite.	
The food is basically half of the portion of the normal size, with about half the price.	
Let me start by saying that I have been reading almost every review on here about this place, and have been chomping at the bit to try it.	
It's sad I like they're food too since it was my first job in high school	
I had blackened red snapper with paremesan encrusted red potatoes and asparagus.	
A large Kobe Burger fan.	
So, a bargain was in the making.	
If you are in the mood for a little change on your gyro get it spicy and with feta.	
Grady's still selling his famous BBQ sauce in bottles from his new storefront.	
The steak I ordered look and tasted delicious, as did everyone's food.	
It is huge and easily 2 meals for under 8 dollars.	
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.	0
Food was below average.	0
you wont be disappointed.	
It's a no-fuss menu with simple, homegrown ingredients in each dish.	
The staff seemed pretty nice, and the owner was cool and enthusiastic (which is a good sign).	
We don't need YOU."	
The 'best' part was someone at the bar says, "Hey, this isn't BS (West)" referring to the nearby gay bar.	
First things first, I took a forkful of beans and held it up, I could see the steam rising from them, I took the bite and was immediately in heaven!	
The others were great as well.	
The bacon/egg pizza is good as is the calimari.	
Exactly what we needed!	
However, they are ALWAYS out of my favorite item, Tiramisu.	
They were mostly quick to my table.	
The ketchup was not empty.	
I get at least 2 a week from these people on my door.	
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.	0
It didn't dawn on me until the next day to look online and see why my lobster smelled of ammonia.	
The setting is Greek, but more that they have a lot of Greek style things on their walls rather than a real atmosphere that omits "Greek" to you.	
All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.	0
Otherwise stay away.	
I asked the nice lady behind the counter what are the two best hotdogs to get and she served me up the chill dog and a Chicago dog.	
I will certainly be back for lunch or dinner and definitely will try the pho when I crave a hot soup.	
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).	0
Then my drink was topped off with ice so after about 4 swallows I needed a refill.	
Amber was really good as well.	
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.	0
Finally, the clearer guy, brought us soup about 25 mins after sat down.	
On a positive note, we're still seeing each other despite my first date dinner pick.	
Beignets are supposed to be lovely and crisp on the inside while light and airy on the inside.	
This happened two more times before the guy finally relented and took the incorrect pie.	
It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.	0
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.	0
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.	0
A must place to eat if you are here in Vegas.	
Best to find somewhere else for now folks.	
We were promptly seated in a large booth - Dotty has some great booths... not gonna' lie.	
I tried it as a recommendation from a friend, great sushi, clean place, great food, great service too, plenty of parking	
Still a pleasant experience, if not bit cramped (but what part of Edinburgh isn't).	
My husband and I decided to stop here for lunch and had the usual hour before we had to go back to work.	
I did appreciate though how each drink came in a mini shaker and was poured tableside.	
As a Floridian turned Arizonian the shrimp was pretty tasty even though it was from Thailand.	
Not so much that we didn't get seated right away but when we left that wasn't the case.	
The interior of the restaurant as well as the bar side are nothing fancy, pretty standard faire for a local restaurant.	
Lovely little restaurant, lovely little surprise.	
Just say no to Jose Cuervo.	
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.	0
I've had it in DC a few times, heck, I've had people bring it to me from time to time.	
The staff are super friendly and will take care of you.	
Amazingly, Yagyu's is even colder.	
Granted this place is probably known for their beer and not their food, but really, how hard is it to supply some decent food?	
don't order draft, those are something like $8/ea and after a bucket's worth, that gets a little pricey for football watching.	
It's not this guys fault you didn't hear him call your name twice because you were taking selfies at your table.	
Things were over-seasoned and I wouldn't order any of these things again.	
It's up to 5 Stars now for this great American Buffet!	
Every entree I have tried is great, from the Pad Thai and Pineapple Curry to the Pad Kea Mow.	
Food is always very fresh tasting and has so much flavor.	
We have no idea what made him sick but he literally broke out into a cold sweat in the middle of the retaurant.	
This was my first visit but most definitely not my last visit I will definitely become a regular fixture at Buldogis.	
A nice maybe elderly lady, blame the lighting, greeted and helped me out with the menu, lunch specials, and time it took to finish.	
Spend your money and time some place else.	0
Wanted to try this place out, Verry good food.	
So she called, and the phone rang..and rang.....and rang until someone answered.	
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.	0
I had the ribs which were meaty, spicy and just fell off of the bone.	
Appetizing comfort food comes in all forms including sandwiches, burgers, soups and greek specialties.	
in fact, dinner was perfectly paced (if you go out to enjoy an evening and aren't just trying to shovel food in your face, that is).	
Winner winner chicken dinner.	
We also got the flatbread (sans bacon).	
So delicious!	
It was a well worth experience.	
I've been to Home Plate more than three different times, one decent (three star experience) and two (one star experiences).	
the presentation of the food was awful.	0
She goes over and starts talking to the 50yr old male cougar and his little cub.	
I was so excited to finally try this place and after the yelp holiday bazaar my friend and I were starving and decided to try it out.	
After all that I'm afraid we won't be going back as there are much better options in the Valley.	
Love this place.	
If you love seafood, cooked the way you like it, then this is a place for you.	
We were really looking forward to this restaurant.	
We also added the Crispy Calamari + Spicy Seared Ahi to our assortment.	
On our last night in Vegas, we decided to have one last meal.	
Standard strip prices.	
They were only slightly cracked.	
It was $6.38?!	
The veal Milanese was like my Grandmothers and the pastafagoile the best in town !	
We bough a dozen and could barely finish half.. My boyfriend almost yacked up one of them because it was already bad.	
I was seated quickly in what seemed to be the busiest part of the restaurant with two large parties around me.	
My bean rice and cheese burrito was excellent.	
Maybe they just had a bad day, but we got the worst service ever in the US.	
The food was good and I will go back !	
Somone should confirm this for me!!	
Because that's all they need!	
A few minutes later our server advised that a snafu on the tickets meant they kitchen didn't get the order so our appetizers were on the house.	
Did you just laugh at a buying customer for their drink order?	
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.	0
Time to bump up the star rating and start encouraging friends to pay it a visit before movies at the Harkins at the other end of the mall.	
My husband and I gave them a try the other night at Fashion Square (I had been to Tatum for drinks only) and were very pleased with our experience.	
I had to get the cook's name...Six.	
Every dish is presented beautifully with lighter fares interjected between the more flavorful ones.	
Good varied brunch menu.	
Shortly thereafter, we had two more friends join....and then two more that had never told us they were coming.	
So I ordered a pizza, half cheese, half pepperoni, to go.	
I tried their grilled pork bahn mi and two shrimp spring rolls.	
Order told him "we every food no onions" but still had Onions inside, The waiter like didn't hear.	
San Jose is too far!!	
Many menu options.	
My boyfriend and hunt them out in other cities.	
That's all you need to know right there."	
Got the lunch roll special to go!	
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.	0
Seriously, can somebody fill me in?	
Appetite instantly gone.	0
Great food might be an understatement, even better prices!	
getting the acai bowls for breakfast is a little early for me to eat something that cold.	
My husband told the maitre'd it was a special occasion, which he ignored and said "tell your waiter" (which we did).	
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.	0
That's a shame too, because it's a great space.	
Not only ours, but we smelled a couple more burned attempts during our meal.	
Soooo tasty!	
Beer is definitely the way to go if you are drinking.	
Had just eaten at a couple high end restaurants (the Sage notably) and had the worst service ever and had to pay for it.	
I've been to Padre's twice now - once for a full dinner and a second time for a margarita and a bite.	
It also states they hav 10 years experience.	
The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.	0
The worst part of the food is the desserts.	
It looked like a couple slices of thick turkey lunch meat packed with fillers.	
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	0
Suddenly, a gush of hot liquid poured from the sky, filling the giant discs partially with an aromatic, steamy pool of stock.	
I opened with a cup of coffee ($3).	
The third one was too.	
This is the very sucks place i ever seen.	
I recommend the Hot Bagels and Deli to my friends and hope you give them a chance next time your around the Carefree and I17 hwy area.	
Great casual (almost divey) atmosphere.	
How fortunate we are that Stefano Fabbri, owner of the new Pomo Pizzeria in the Borgata, is a pizza fanatic.
