    "For a lot of data files in class we'll use functionality from various libraries to process data very quickly. However, for custom files, raw text, and data that is configured in a non-standard way, it is important to be able to extract data in a customized fashion. We'll go through this exercise using only libraries that come with the default python distribution. The first step will be to open the file in sublime.\n",

Our goal is to take the raw commits, sort our authors alphabetically and also count the number of contributions they made. Let's first look at the file. You can do this via the command line but for simplicity's sake we can use the Jupyter cell magic."
