We can use [Principal Components Analysis](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/decomposition.html#pca) and then plot only the \"top two\" dimensions. More technically, these are the dimensions that capture most of the variance in our data set. For this extra credit question, read about [PCA in the sklearn.decomposition module](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html), apply it to the wholesale dataset, repeat the k-means clustering, and plot your results using only the top two principal components."
