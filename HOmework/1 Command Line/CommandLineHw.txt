## Using chipotle.tsv in the data subdirectory:
## Look at the head and the tail, and think for a minute about how the 
head ../../data/chipotle.tsv
tail ../../data/chipotle.tsv

## data is structured. What do you think each column means? What do you ## think each row means? Tell me! (If you're unsure, look at more of 
## the file contents.)
## Each line is an order, the name of the item, the price, and the ingredients

# How many orders do there appear to be?
wc -l ../../data/chipotle.tsv

# How many lines are in the file?
# 4623 
# Which burrito is more popular, steak or chicken?
grep -i "chicken" ../../data/chipotle.tsv > countchicken.csv
grep -i "steak" ../../data/chipotle.tsv > countsteak.csv
# chicken by doing word count
wc -l countchicken.csv
wc -l countsteak.csv
# chicken is more popular

# Do chicken burritos more often have black beans or pinto beans?
grep -i "black beans" countchicken.csv > countblack.csv
grep -i "pinto beans" countchicken.csv > countpinto.csv

wc -l countblack.csv
wc -l countpinto.csv

# Make a list of all of the CSV or TSV files in the DAT7 repo (using a #single command). Think about how wildcard characters can help you with # this task.
ls ../../*/*.?sv

#Count the number of occurrences of the word 'dictionary' (regardless of case) across all files in the DAT7 repo.
grep -r "dictionary" ./../*/
